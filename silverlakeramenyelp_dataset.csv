Start your review of Silverlake Ramen.
I have been here at least 3 times to dine in person. Hospitality was always excellent but service was always slow since they are always so packed. Either arrive before the rush or order take out.
"I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back."
"Hi Bianca, I’m thrilled to see that you enjoyed your meal.  Take care!"
"I have been here twice in the last two weeks and it is yummy. Great service and awesome food and high quality. My family and I love Silverlake Ramen, double thumbs up."
Thanks for your kind words!  Take care.
"Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was ""ok"" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow."
"Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill."
Thanks for sharing Carolyn!  Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
"*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was ""off"" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen."
"Probably one of the best broths for ramen that I've had thus far. There's a hint of roasted garlic in the tonkotsu broth that just completes it.You order and pay from kiosks in the front, then show your receipt to the host in the front who will seat you. There's a variety of seating options: the traditional table, high table, bar or patio seating. This makes it welcoming for parties of all sizes. We sat at the bar so we weren't hoarding a table from bigger parties. Maybe about a 15-minute wait for food at most, but that was because there were lots of take-out orders before us.We ordered a small karaage with spicy aioli sauce, the classic tonkotsu ramen and the blaze ramen. Like I said before--the broth was amazing! Noodles were firm and on the thinner side, and the chashu was a tender slab of pork belly that was to die for. For the blaze ramen, you had a choice of 3 levels of spiciness. At level 2, my boyfriend said it was still flavorful with a kick of heat. We highly recommend this place. Apparently there's another Silverlake Ramen in Silver Lake (yes, that was a ""no, duh"" moment for me). We just happened to stumble upon this location. There's plenty of parking in this mall and no wait when we came. Apparently the wait is ridiculous at the Silver Lake location, so just plan ahead."
The black garlic oil really does wonders!  I’m glad you had a wonderful experience here.  See you soon.
"Decided to try a new ramen place. When first walking in, we were directed to the right to place our order. There is two options in ordering. You can either order on the touch screen or with the host. We opted to do the touch screen to see the set up. It was very easy to use however if you want to order quick and be sat quick then order with the host. About 3 parties after us ordered through the host and was sat before our order was submitted. We ordered a California roll and 2 Blaze Ramens with pork. The California roll was dry but the Blaze Ramen was good. We were pleasantly surprised that the pieces of pork were very thick and juicy. It was a bit salty but it went well with the broth. The noodles were on the thin side and were hotter bottom of the bowl.Flavor wise: The broth itself was creamy with a subtle flavor to it. For those who like spice, the spicy paste added a nice heat that wasn't overbearing. You can also control the amount of spice by choosing your option of mild, medium or hot. If you would like it spicier there is a jar of spicy paste on every table.Temperature wise: The broth was warm but could've been hotter and the egg was cold in the center. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very clean, modern and there was good music playlist. The restaurant is small but it seemed more spacious due to the ceiling being elevated and the amount of windows. It has limited seating inside but they have a patio area to make up for it. The staff was not too attentive other than bringing our food, probably because it was slow. On the bright side, most of what we needed was on the table. They had good spoons and good quality chopsticks, which if always appreciated when eating a bowl of ramen. We ended up sitting in-between both of the doors since it was the only seating available inside which kind of sucked because we got air coming in from both ways. Price: The bowls were on the pricier side. We paid about $40 for 2 bowls and 1 California Roll. Every side extra cost about an extra $0.50-$1.50It wasn't a bad experience nor a good experience."
"This place is located in that new shopping/eating center in Long Beach, right by the airport. My wife brought me here because we both love ramen. We were looking for a new ramen place too, since the one we used to frequent has dropped down in quality quite a bit. Not to mention, Silverlake Ramen has Tonkatsu brother that is deeper, richer, and tastier than any Tonkatsu Broth I've had so far here in the United States. By that, I mean to imply that I've also had Tokatsu ramen, at various other places, when I used to live in Michigan. The noodles are nice and thick, but not too thick. The egg is PERFECTLY cooked with the consistency being somewhere between soft boiled and medium boiled. I believe it has some kind of seasoning on it too, which is a nice touch. When I saw pictures of their Tokatsu on their Yelp listing, I got really excited because the broth looked really thick and milky/cloudy. That's usually a really good sign that the Tokatsu broth is REALLY tasty. Oh, and the pork is really lean, and less fatty than a lot of other ramen places I've tried.Anyway, 10/10, would have again!"
"Came on a Thursday night, 6pm ish in Jan. No wait...Minus:1. the weird way to order (millennial-ish kiosk) 2. weird way to get seated (no one really tells you how the order, seating is supposed to work).3. Lack of ""service""-no one really greets you after you sit, they just look at your receipt, drop your ramen bowl off.. then you are left alone unless you flag someone down for whatever your need.Parking: easy tons a lbx. Park by the tj max side.. easy/out.I really liked my ramen and gyoza! Edamame pass... micowave tasting beans and minimal salt..meh (you should do spicy garlic edamame!!I got:-the shoyu on fire level 2 spice with pork bellyThis was sooo delish! Clean broth, lots of umami.  The roasted jalapeno, fresh geen onion, slab o meat, corn kernels all worked well.-great ratio noodles to broth (you can order more noodles on the side if you like stuffing your face with more carbs).-noodles were perfect.  Bit of chewy.. not soggy.-the fire level was perfect.  Keeps the hot in you mouth without worrying about gonna come out the other end the next day.We sat at the small kitchen counter watching the ramen cooking craze.Its a small space.  Maybe sits 50ish people max, less tables more community seating.They seem to do a TON of take outs which is maybe why the in  house service folks are distracted.We'd come back.  Hope they work on their customer service a bit... would have given 5 stars of so."
"Based on the name of this place, I had a feeling Silverlake Ramen would have vegan options. Luckily their menu clearly states what is vegetarian and they also provide an allergen menu online so I can further research what is plant-based.The Veggie Ramen has tasty miso-based broth! I like that the presentation is very green due to the broccolini, baby greens, kale, and avocado. This is the first time I've had avocado in ramen. Not sure how I feel about that but I also won't kick it out of bed. There's also tofu, corn, and bean sprouts. Though you can't see it in my photo, there are mushrooms hidden under all those toppings. This dish is very noodle heavy which might hit the spot for some people. But I might ask if I can get half the amount of noodles next time. The day we came here, it was a particularly cold December evening so this soup totally hit the spot! bit.ly/2QxjVI3The Mabo Tofu Bowl was quite yummy as well. It is a bit different from other mapo tofu dishes I've had. Usually, I have the sauce mixed in with the tofu. This version has the sauce on top of the tofu. I loved the eggplant! The ginger was a nice addition and I love that it was topped with fresh green onions. I hoped that they had brown rice as an option but unfortunately they don't have it. But I'm hoping they might consider offering it in the future. bit.ly/2QOHmeMThe two times we've been here, they had a cashier taking orders. It makes me wonder why they have the self-service touch screens? I prefer customer service from a real person anyway. And they're friendly and helpful here too. Also, purse hooks at the bar-height tables!Plenty of free parking at LBX including charging stations for our Tesla :)"
"Wow! What a delicious and efficient ramen spot! I stopped by to have lunch here and it was everything I could have wanted. You order upon entry so it's quick-- no need to wait for a server or anything and your food comes out within minutes.I order the Classic ramen with pork belly and I could not get enough. The soup was the perfect amount of creamy and the egg was smooth and cooked just right. (My mouth is seriously watering as I write this). The portions are also super generousThe servers are patient and attentive and while parking can be tough, it is very worth the stop. I can't wait to dine her again!**they take Apple Pay which is perfect if you forget your wallet"
"I came here on a Monday lunch and we didn't have to wait. You order at the kiosk or the cashier and proceed to find your own seat. We got the classic and the blaze ramen, the latter apparently being their best seller. You can pick the meat (we picked pork on both). We also ordered a pork bun on the side.The food comes out fairly quick. The broth is very creamy and thick - really rich ramen. The bowls have decent servings of noodles and soup and a thick cut of pork.I think that the classic and blaze have the same base but the blaze with the spice takes it to another level, so I would recommend this. The bun was ok - pork was excellent but I wasn't feeling the mayo.Overall not bad - I would like to try their gyoza or rice bowls next time just to try.Perhaps between 2 people one ramen and the others on the side would be enough, as I wasn't able to finish my ramen.Then again, it was lunch and i don't normally eat a lot for lunch."
"Supah creamyyyy ramen and pork CHOP belly like at an American steakhouse. They're huge! Friend got the tsukemen, got 3 meats, which was Overkill, but he gave me 1 of them for The Blaze that I got which only had 1, and that's not cool.Geeeeet the black garlic oil with the classic blaze! Try half without, then finish the second half with the oil, A WHOLE DIFF SOUP.The crispy rice appetizer is like eating Hashbrowns! Supah solid. Fun to take a few bites into it. Mushrooms with the salad are solid. Decent portion, nice vinagrette. Feels like modern take on a ramen restaurant, down to the food choices, vibe, and logistics of it."
"I ate at the original Silverlake Ramen in Silverlake a few years ago, and loved their Veggie Ramen. I recall it being rich, flavorful, and creamy. The company has since rapidly expanded, and when this new location popped up in Long Beach, I was excited to try them again. We ordered delivery via Postmates, since we are out of their delivery range-they are located near the airport. This time, the Veggie Ramen was barely edible. The grayish broth was completely flavorless, and the weird assortment of veggies (broccolini, corn, huge chunks of undercooked soft tofu, avocado (?!)) had a bitter aftertaste. I love avocado as much as the next Californian, but it has no place in ramen. The noodles were okay, albeit not fresh. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen and was equally underwhelmed. We also got the Seaweed Salad, which was too sweet and drowning in dressing, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl, which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall, a really disappointing meal. Avoid."
"One taste of the spicy, creamy tonkotsu broth and I knew... my experience was going to be extraordinary.At Silverlake, the ramen is prepared fresh and articulate. Generous toppings are given, great portion sizes are delivered, and flavors tend to soak me into moments where my tastebuds seemed to have a fun time exploring this new and creative flavor. The broth is Oh, So Creamy!-- the creamiest ever... and that was why Silverlake's experience was so unique.Truly great!"
"Hi Desiree,I’m very happy to hear about your experience!  Hope to see you again soon.  Take care."
"Silverlake Ramen was one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I moved to LB for college. I've dined in quite often to get my ramen fix with friends and I have only great experiences here! I always order the Blaze ramen because it's so good and gives the right amount of kick. The noodles here are light and chewy. The broth is super creamy and tastes amazing. One thing I found really interesting was the way you order before being seated. It doesn't seem to pose a problem for me so I just go with the flow. Be careful though because wait times here can get pretty insane. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a fulfilling, warm bowl of ramen in the LB area (:"
"So much hype around Silverlake Ramen and now I don't have to drive too far!Parking wasn't terrible as the shopping area is large. Location is a decent size and had a very open vibe. You enter and order at the kiosk or with the cashier and they help you find a seat. Waiters were friendly but it did take some time to flag a couple down since it was busy. Not their fault though.Ramen was a solid 7/10! The broth was great and tasty, just wish I had a tad more noodles"
"The arguable king in Ramen on the eastside of Los Angeles arrives in Long Beach. Much like Pizza, Pho, and Sushi, many will judge you based on your favorites and although I am hesitant to commit to a single favorite - on Yelp anyway - nearly half of Los Angeles would swear by Silverlake Ramen which is unlikely due to its location on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, you shouldn't be able to find a real deal bowl of Ramen on Sunset of all places, right? Wrong. Well, Silverlake Ramen has done so well for itself it is expanding with a new spot in Long Beach and another on the way for Irvine in The Spectrum. The Long Beach location is in the center of The Hangar, a newly developed (and extremely trendy) area featuring a massive food hall and boutique-style stores near the Long Beach Airport or the ""LGB"" if you are a local. The interior is modern, sleek, and a little funky as far as a modern Ramen joint goes but the ordering procedure is... well... straight-up wack thanks to the single ordering kiosk being employed, the weird way they assign you to a table, and the line back up this creates. The only plus about this strange fast-casual format is that tips are unnecessary. As for the Ramen itself? I thought you'd never ask. I naturally ordered the celebrated Tonkatsu Ramen. The presentation of the Ramen is quite noble. The portions include an adequate amount of food to serve a single starving person or two reasonably hungry people (perhaps 3?). The pork broth takes 16 hours to render which makes it both intense and savory, with the rich essences erupting at the first spoonful. The Chashu is laid over the Noodles and a bed of Green Onions, which were cleverly glazed on the edges. The Chashu dissolved in the mouth and implemented the ideal amount of saltiness.The Bean Sprouts provided a crunchiness that juxtaposes itself flawlessly with the smoothness of the Noodles. It is merited to mention that a single bowl is remarkably filling, with multiple customers taking to-go bowls home on my visit. For a mere $13.00 after-tax, it is a deal that cannot be missed. I was highly impressed with Silverlake Ramen and cannot wait for a return stop. They clearly have found significant investment capital as this is not the only outpost they are opening - expect to see new locations soon in Huntington Beach, Irvine, Cerritos, Oxnard, and Koreatown. Ramen lovers rejoice!"
"Expensive for ramen but quite substantial. The Classic Tonkotsu and the Blaze are both super rich. If the broths were any thicker, they'd be tsukemen broth. In fact, the two items are so similar that I suspect the only difference is the chili paste in the Blaze. I love that they use spinach in the ramen. It's not common to find actual green vegetable in ramen and the spinach was a great addition to the creamy broth. I also love the thick chasu pork. It's fatty and tender and super satisfying to bite into. Although there is technically only one slice of chashu, I couldn't actually finish it in one sitting and had to take it home."

"When you think of Ramen, the Long Beach area usually doesn't come to mind. Well, a few spots have opened up and Silverlake is one of them. If you hadn't heard of the Long Beach Exchange - it's a new addition to the food scene in the Long Beach area. Silverlake Ramen isn't located in the Hangar, but as one of the shops next to Georgia's, facing Ulta and Old Navy. Lots of parking. At least that's what my friend and I found when we stopped in for a very late lunch one weekday. I don't know how packed the lot gets during lunch hour or on the weekends however, we drove up, and right into a spot. Walked in, ordered and sat down. No wait. The experience started off well and only got better from there. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu and a Chicken Karaage. I know it's like a broken record when I say it wasn't spicy, but it wasn't. However, the broth wasn't bland or too oily and for my taste, didn't need much in the way of condiments for flavor. The noodles were done al dente, as I prefer. As for the chicken, I liked the juicy meat however, the skin was a little too done for me. Not sure if that makes sense however, it seemed like it was bathed in oil too long and for me the outer layer had an oily taste. The dipping sauce which comes with the order took care of that taste for me - otherwise I might have considered sending it back. The service was friendly and efficient. Attentive not so much as not much was needed. Someone took our order. Someone brought our utensils and water. Then someone brought our order to the table. Not much follow up was needed as the bill was already paid and we were close enough to the water dispenser for refills. I had a pleasant experience. The only feedback I have is that the music volume was a little too loud. Most of the visit, I had difficulty hearing my friend speak."
"Yay a good RAMEN place in LB!Located directly behind Georgia's, Silverlake Ramen brings the ramen fire! You walk in and make a right to the register to order and pay. You can choose to tip at this time or leave a tip on your table before you leave. They give you a number and wait for your ramen to be served to you. There is outdoor seating as well as heaters. This was my first time eating here and the service was pretty good. The servers bring your drinks to your table. Onto the ramen, I got the shoyu with the pork belly. It was so good. The pork belly piece was so thick and tender. It was a good portion and I didn't even finish it. The noodles were standard and the broth was tasty. The broth could be a little hotter (temperature wise) in my opinion. But otherwise it was good. Parking isn't an issue and it shares the lot with other businesses. I'll probably come back and try the tonkotsu and e karaage!"
"Got my ramen delivered but I've been hearing so much about this place. I chose the blaze- a spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! The ramen broth was so tasty. For my protein I choose chicken. I've never had chicken in my ramen unless get it without protein. The texture didn't sit right with me so I took it out. After that, everything was superb. I appreciate the presentation and the prices were average for a joint at the hanger."
"Ambiance: the set-up is totally bad!!! They only have one register open.Very chilled with an average noise level inside as for the outside it's too cramped and one of the table is blocking the exit way. Food: Pork bun is a must, the pork belly is so soft and the Saunders with the bun went well together. Crispy chicken karaage was not crispy at all, it's not what a karaage is usually is (you'll see in the picture). The chicken itself is lightly breaded so it's more like on a healthy side so they should rename it to something else. The Shoyu was good, the chicken was tender and soft enough to chew on, the broth was delicious. The Blaze ramen was okay, the broth was a little too thick for me and the pork belly that came with it was very hard and hard to chew I would have expected to be soft like the pork bun but I was really disappointed. Service: They were lagging because they were having a receipt print out problem and it took them a while till we can finally order, wished they offered a free drink after eating for nearly 10min until our order was place. The waiter did follow up once we were seated but it took them forever for my pork bun or the katrsge and our ramen came first/"
"I was more than excited hearing that a Silverlake Ramen was opening in Long Beach! I love going to and trying new Ramen places but Silverlake will always be one of my staple favorites to go to. I got the spicy tonkotsu, the blaze. First off, the broth was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from the spice. The noodles were well cooked, had a good texture and was accompanied by pork that was very tender. Every time I come here, it is always packed with people, but in my opinion, the food is worth the wait."
"Not too much a fan of ramen, but my brother is a ramen connoisseur and took me here since it was new and close to home. Gotta say, the ramen was fine (again, I'm not a huge fan). My mom, dad, aunt enjoyed it so no complaints. If you're looking for a hot bowl of soup, this place will do. ^_^By the way. They use the new type of touch ordering system and then make you wait before you sit down. I'm not a fan of the new trend in touch ordering , but oh well."
"My friends & I were so happy to hear about this spot opening up! It's located at LBX, near other restaurants. Parking isn't bad. We came on a Sunday afternoon & surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected for a grand opening. When you walk in, you order first then find a seat. It's not bad, but going in with a fairly big group, it might be hard to find seats together. They do have outside seating though and their tables are pretty close to each other both in and outside. They also have bar seating a high table seating with seats on one side. Their service is great too!It took maybe like 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the classic tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the blaze one. My other friends ordered the same as us. I was honestly expecting a lot since I loved it when I went to the LA location. However, I was underwhelmed.. The broth wasn't as rich and flavorful. The meat was a little chewy and dry for me. They also forgot to add meat to one of the orders. We were a bit surprised by that lol. The noodles were good and chewy though! The egg was fine, but wish it was more of a soft boiled egg. Maybe it wasn't as great since it was still their opening weekend. But definitely will give it another visit in the future."
Thank you for your review.  I will bring this to my team so we can continue to work on perfecting our broth and meat texture.  I hope we can serve you again in the near future.
"I decided to try this place for the first time with a friend for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We didn't have to wait since it wasn't busy. One thing that I noticed right off was the self order kiosk. It was super convenient to just walk in and order what you wanted without having any pressure. The menu on the kiosk provided pictures of the food and it made the ordering process fast and easy. I decided to order the vegetarian ramen and I was a little hesitant at first but it didn't disappoint me. The broth was super flavorful and it had a good amount of vegetables and noddles. They also provide soy sauce and gyro sauce along with a chili paste to add more flavor. I was satisfied with the overall taste, presentation portion, and service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or is trying ramen for the first time. You won't regret it because your tummy will be happy."
"I landed in Los Angeles and not even an hour later, I'm already hitting up a restaurant cos' I am just a hangry girl! This was the place I came across first because it was the closest ramen shop to the car rental place I was at. What do I order at a ramen shop? Not ramen of course. I got three dishes: a side of bamboo shoots, a cucumber salad with imitation crab meat and a Shiitake Enoki mushroom salad (Don't recall the proper name of the salad but I can't seem to find it on their website.) The salads were just meh but I don't blame them because this is a ramen place after all. I really like how they have a self serve kiosk where you can make your own order and then you sit down and they will bring you your food. I see this is very common in LA and very uncommon in NYC.The staff was friendly and the place is nice and bright and very welcoming. I like this place. I should try their ramen sometime."
Thank you for the review.  Hopefully you can come back to taste our ramen!
"As my hunt continues for the best ramen out there - I have found quite a few worthy contenders. Silverlake does not fall into that category. The ramen here is okay - and the entirety of the experience gets merely a pass. The seating is awkward as you order and pay first then wait to be seated - What kind of service and quality of food am I tipping for, beforehand? The food wasn't very hot upon arrival which always uncomfortably settles. There's not much to write home about. Silverake is worth a try to determine for oneself what the rating is."
"I have been meaning to visit the original location for some time, but guess what?! No need now. Silverlake Ramen recently expanded to a commercial shopping area near LB Airport off Lakewood (Hwy 19) and Carson. I typically avoid these types of centers, so I quit being a judgmental weenie and went for it.The menus are up front and you have to go to the right to see the cashier to order before sitting. I had the Cucumber Salad with crab and Shoyu on Fire. Their Shoyu Ramen is made with pork, chicken, or tofu in a clear chicken broth with shoyu, green onion, corn, seaweed, jalapeño, lime, and egg. I also added bamboo shoots. It was balanced and perfectly spiced at level 2. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They'll also being utilizing a self-service kiosk soon for"

Solid Ramen in Long Beach! Yay! The Family all liked our bowls--I ordered the Blaze #2 spicy & I was sweatin' just a bit.  It was delicious. The broth is so creamy--creamier than I ever remember having before & I've had a lot of Ramen.  And I'm not hatin'. Just sayin'. I also love that chicken is a meat option. Welcome to the neighborhood Silverlake.
"Went here during their grand opening last Monday and came 15 minutes before the yelp listed opening time...and they were already open. It seems like the team did it to accommodate the rush that they were expecting so props to them.As others have noted, you order up front and find a seat. I can't imagine how rough that is if you go to peak hours. But Silverlake Ramen (according to their website) seems to be in an aggressive growth stage so more locations are coming up possibly leading to shorter wait times.When places like Silverlake ramen open up, you do notice the tide of gentrification is rising in LB. I mention this because it's a bit pricy (ramen isn't usually cheap, but this place doesn't really have any ""budget"" options). The quality is there, but recognizing the status of where LB is and where it's heading is important too.I got the classic tonkotsu. The broth is very creamy and that's what Silverlake ramen is known for. The only other place I've been to with similarly creamy broth is Foo Foo Tei in Hacienda Heights/City of Industry. It was delicate level of creaminess that didn't feel overwhelming or too thick. I did add extra garlic to my ramen, but that's just me. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth soft, but they weren't very generous serving-wise. Like I said, there are very few bang for your buck ramen places because quality is key. This place, despite the restaurant's look and feel, is a little more on the high end.I'd skip the appetizers. A lot of them you can find at a mom and pop place in better quantities that taste just as good. But Silverlake ramen's ramen is worth the hype and definitely worth trying out.I saw the place tease an electronic register and a...pesto ramen. I'll be back because I'm curious, but I also really enjoy their broth."
"We went the evening of the grand opening, and a lot of the four stars here are attributable to the great customer service which we received.  From the cashier, to the food expediter who checked in on us to apologize for the timing, and even to the check-ins after we got our meal, we definitely were made to feel attended to.As far as the actual food goes, the ramen is thoughtfully crafted, the spicy tonkotsu broth is complex in flavor, and the noodles appear to be housemade...but I found the chasu to be chewy, the bean sprouts limp, and the overall dish lacked a little zing that maybe some garlic or onion could have added."
Thank you for your review.  I will go over the review with my team as we are continuously working to improve our bowls.
"I came here with 4 other friends on a Saturday night. It was moderately  busy, but there were some tables open outside (yes, there's  a heater). However, we decided to wait for a table inside and it only took about 10 minutes to be seated.I was helped by Samantha who alleviated a lot of indecisiveness for my meal. She was super patient  with me, despite me asking her a lot of questions about what to order and even made some funny remarks when answering my questions. She delivers great customer service and made me feel comfortable while speaking to her. I ended up going with her recommendation of the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen and was happy about my decision. Thanks, Samantha! :)"
"Not impressed. The pork slices were tough and too lean for my liking. Also, they rejected me when I asked for water to dilute my Tsukemen"
"Wow! I don't know why it's taken so long for me to try this place! My friends and I came around 6pm on a Sunday night and got seated pretty quickly. Service was amazing and our servers, Andy & Rumil, were so kind! Despite being quite busy, we were checked up on frequently and our water cups never went empty.I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with pork and it was rich and flavorful! I would definitely get this again.also lemme tell ya'll, that pork was THICC"
"I really don't see what the hype with the place is. We came soon after their soft opening so maybe they're working out the kinks, but there was a huge line to get in, not because the place was packed, but because you have to order from a host before you can sit. That process was very slow, and you looked inside and could clearly see the restaurant wasn't filled yet, so the line just gives an illusion of being full, seemed like hype-building to me. Looks like little kiosks will be used instead which will likely make the process more efficient. The food was ok, filling but I still think more expensive than it should've been. We both got the vegan ramen, the toppings really seemed random, didn't go that well together or with the broth. First we thought maybe just the vegan ramen is blah, and just an afterthought (to which I say, don't serve it if you're not gonna put effort into it), but my non-vegan coworker also said it's over-hyped. It's just ok, and service was nice, but really can't recommend."
"I have been a bit skeptical about trying this place for awhile. A lot of my friends that have went there warned me of the terrible customer service so I've been purposely avoiding it. However, I was craving ramen recently since I had a cold so I decided to order the Classic Tonkotsu ramen for pick up. I made sure to order To-Go in order to prevent an interaction with rude employees -- but that didn't quite work out. On arrival, one of the employees, a tall Filipino(?) guy, walked up to the front without a single word to greet me. I was very sick and I had just got off work followed by school but I smiled and said hello and told him I was here for a pickup order. He looked incredibly annoyed like he wanted to shoot himself in the foot. Still no word spoken, he goes to the To-Go orders and asks if my name was Adam. I told him yes, he gives me the food, and says NOTHING else. He made it pretty obvious that he wanted me out as soon as possible and I was a nuisance to him.I exchanged less than 10 words with him and it made me never want to come back again. Usually I get over these interactions as I used to work in customer service for years, but it still annoys me thinking about it now. It's not hard to smile and be courteous; if it is, you're in the wrong job.If the ramen was worth it, maybe I would come back but it was honestly just okay. Not worth getting annoyed over so I don't think I'll ever come back here again. I should have listened to all the warnings I received about the poor customer service, would have saved me the headache."
"This is my favorite ramen place in the Long Beach area. The pork is thick but it's so tender and flavorful. The broth is great and noodles are so good. Perfect for those cold California days. Their service is pretty fast and p The only downside is the place is pretty small. Not too many tables inside. A few table outside but I prefer indoors. Update: They usually include two slices of pork in the ramen but the last couple of times I ate here, they only put one slice of the pork. It's disappointing because it was a good portion. Why do they have to take something good away from their customers? Having second thoughts to eating here anymore."

"To the only male Filipino server who served us on 2/24/20 around 2:30pm, you are a L I A R. And you know it! We ordered TWO blaze ramen (1 without bean sprout, ADD $1 BLACK GARLIC OIL) and an order of crispy rice w/ spicy tuna. He comes to our table KNOWING we ordered 2 blaze (he recommended this!), yet STILL asked ""who ordered the classic?"" We said nobody did. Then stupidly says, ""oh, well they forgot to add the spice to the Original - which is the only difference from the blaze. But we have the spice on the side (on the table)."" SO CLEARLY, HE JUST WAS LAZY TO SEND IT BACK. I told him, it was fine, but also made it known that they forgot to remove the bean sprouts. He offered to remake it when I complained about the bean sprouts (as that was strike 2 in a matter of 20 seconds), but I opted out of that, as I was already hangry at this point.However, when he pointed out that ""the only difference between the classic and the blaze is the SPICE"" and that it's ON THE TABLE, I ASKED HIM if what I RECIEVED (classic) was the SAME price as what I ordered (blaze). He stated, that it was. I was still skeptical bc I could have sworn that it wasn't, but I STILL did not say anything, bc I trusted his word. In addition, to being OVER CHARGED for the ramen I ordered, I was CHARGED for the BLACK GARLIC OIL ($1), but it ALREADY CAME WITH THE CLASSIC that again, I DID NOT ORDER. Sure, the price difference is ONLY $12.50 to $12.95 PLUS the $1 that I was charged for the oil that ALREADY CAME W THE WRONG ORDER HE GAVE ME, but that is not the takeaway from this. Where is your honesty, you freaking liar! You KNEW what I ordered, YET straight up LIED to your customer. Where is your decency?! To management - I really hope you find out who was working that day, as he needs customer service training, and honesty training. FYI - it was just my bf and I + another couple in the corner booths near their little office space. It is very, very, unfortunate that this was probably one of the best ramen I've had. But something so small like the DISHONESTY of an employee can easily ruin that. To that server - be a man and admit to your mistake."
"This is one of my new favorite ramen spots and I am very picky about how I like my ramen!! I got the blaze tonkatsu and it was delicious. The broth is packed with flavor and I love the way the pork is cooked.  It is a little pricy compared to other ramen places, but the portion size is good.  I also ordered from here once on DoorDash, and they forgot to give me part of my order :( so I knocked a star off for that."
"Long Beach has been beset by a ramen craze the past couple of years. I'm not the biggest fan of all the spots, but I still try them all as they open, just in case. We wandered into Silverlake Ramen with low expectations. The entry is a bit weird and I was distracted by the pesto ramen (what a strange idea). I almost ordered it, but I chose the classic ramen instead. I was happy about my decision when I saw another person eating it. I thought it would be more like pasta, but it looked very soupy and unappetizing. I didn't try it, however, so it might have been delicious.While waiting for our food, I started reading some of the negative reviews and commentary. We were slightly concerned, but when the ramen came, it was pretty good. The broth doesn't have the same depth as HiroNori's, but we were surprised by the flavor nonetheless. Let me just say that adding a dash of the tabletop chili enhances the taste tenfold, so you have to try it. Overall, this is now my second favorite ramen place in the neighborhood. Welcome!"
"Long overdue review! I came with my husband during soft opening. There was a line but we didn't end up waiting too long as there was seating available in the patio area. Upon entering the restaurant, you enter the line to order and there's a cool view of the open kitchen. The two of us shared the crispy chicken karaage, three kinds of mushrooms in butter, and tonkotsu ramen.Crispy Chicken Karaage: It has a good chicken to batter ratio and the flavor was there, but unfortunately it wasn't crispy.Three Kinds of Mushrooms in Butter: Very simple dish with three types of mushrooms in a butter sauce, with some salad on the side. Tonkotsu Ramen: Noodles were chewy, the soup was flavorful and rich, and it didn't leave me feeling super bloated. (Tonkotsu is usually really heavy for me.) The meat was a bit lean; I think I would've enjoyed it more if it was a bit fattier. Service was okay. No bad notes about the service, but also nothing memorable about the service. Not sure that I'd wait longer than maybe 30 min for this, but it was worth trying!"
"Love the atmosphere of this place. Nice interior, very modern, and honestly you can't go wrong with ramen. I got the tsukemen dipping ramen and I loved every bite. We got the pork belly buns and loved the juiciness of every bite. Definitely have to come back to try different appetizers and other ramen dishes. Service was great! Parking is easy since there's a lot.  There's outside seating and inside. Amazing food and service will definitely be back."
Happy that another solid ramen spot has been added to Long Beach! Heard a lot of great things about Silverlake Ramen and it definitely lives up to the hype! I ordered the Blaze Tonkatsu in Medium Spice. Great flavor and huge portion! I could definitely go for more spice the next time I visit. Excellent customer service. Good amount of seating options and lots of parking. Will definitely be back!
Good ramen taste wise but there were a few things that were off putting to me. Our table didn't have spoons and the tofu in my soup was ice cold. The service was nonexistent. It was my first time to this place so I wanted to know if the chili at the table was super spicy. But I couldn't find anyone to ask.
"I have been able to try this place out a week ago. I think this place is a great addition to the Long Beach food scene. I am not a ramen guru, but I do know what I like. The place was moderately crowded but the flow of service was good. There have been previous complaints on long wait time and poor service, but I feel that new restaurants should be given a chance to improve and make changes. But the more important part is how the food taste. They have a few other items besides ramen. But ramen is what you come for. The tonkatsu ramen is where it's at. Very flavorful broth and noodles were on point. I love the black garlic oil that comes with the ramen. Pork buns were also very nice. I never tried the original location so I can't say how close it is in flavor to the original. I suggest given this place a try. You won't be disappointed."
"I came to this location with a friend and we thought the place was pretty good. I had the Veggie Ramen and my friend got the Spicy Miso Ramen. The broth and the veggies were pretty good on my end. I love the broccoli and mushroom based broth. The noodles were okay though. They were a tad bit under cooked but the broth and veggie combo made up for it nevertheless. I truly adored the aesthetics of the restaurant. I love how open and modern the space was. It was truly inviting. Also, the customer service was excellent. They were speedy and present when attending to my friend and I's needs. Overall, I think Silverlake Ramen is a lovely addition to the Long Beach Exchange. I think that with better attention to the noodles and broth, Silverlake Ramen could have the potential in being one of the greats (in terms of ramen) here in SoCal."
"I do not yelp much. Maybe I am hungry and little grumpy.Not a big fan of the prepay idea. Forces your customer to be less likely leave, when the food takes too long.*order a large meal, cause I was particularly hungry today..Update: talked to employees. They seem really nice and sincere. But stomach is growling...2nd update: staff came back and was really nice. They comp my food. Feel bad about posting this. Must have been hangry."
"Was doing work in the area and stopped in for lunch. Maybe I came on a bad day?This is obviously a straight take out place by the airport, which is cool as long as the food is good...Chashu was mediocre at best, noodles under done, the broth, which came separately from the ingredients, was no only cold, but left a weird residue on the plate. Like the mixture they used didn't dissolve long enough. I guess you can certainly do worse then this place but with so many great ramen places in the area, I won't be coming back."
"UPDATED REVIEW: 10/24/192nd visit to Silverlake Ramen, ordered the Blaze level 2 spicy which was very enjoyable but if you want extra noodles as is common at most ramen places, be prepared to wait almost 10 mins for it. This demonstrated how ordering up front, then sit-down second system is very flawed. We had one server tell us he could take care of it and another server tell us we had to wait in line again, but ultimately they just took our card and swiped it for the extra noodle order. Not uncommon to decide you want extra food as you're eating, and didn't want to wait back in ordering line.However, there was very little follow-up and we had to repeatedly ask where our extra noodle order was and by then our broth was cold and not as enjoyable. Table service is not their strength as evidenced by little follow-up, so paying in advance including pre-paying for tip/table service, do at your own discretion. You order, then they bring you the food and drinks. But don't expect much after that in terms of actual table ""service"". Makes for a completely different dining experience. But the staff seemed more than ready to clean up our table and clear our plates when we appeared finished eating. Cleanliness was good, service needs improvement.Just wanted to give others fair warning about this, that although the food is tasty, service can greatly affect your dining experience. Past the soft opening stages, with room for improvement. The chicken karaage bowl was delicious with generous portion sizes, and was served with some kind of aoli sauce on top. (Not your traditional karaage) Also, the pork served with the ramen bowl is not what I remember from when I visited the original location. I distinctly remember pork meat that was tender, flavorful but also served with some skin-on, deep fried and crunchy. (Almost like lechon) This is what made it unique and stand out from other pork ramen bowls. Craving this but I realize not all locations are created equal. Hoping that the LB location would be able to come close to it.The pork served here is a large piece but definitely on the fatty side with little edible meat. Perhaps it just adds flavor to the broth by soaking in it? I just didn't finish eating it.As for dessert or ordering any other food, we opted against it based on the inconvenience of ordering more as went. Missed opportunity, but wonder if any one else has had similar experiences."
"Got here for soft opening today 9/26 at 5pm. Casual atmosphere, ordered at cashier up front, then self-seating with options to sit at the bar, tables inside or outdoor patio. Kaarage chicken is a solid appetizer, crispy outside yet still juicy on the inside with a hint of ginger. We also tried the 3 kinds of mushroom with butter (with salad) which was different and worth trying. Classic tonkotsu ramen is the standard for me, pork broth with black garlic oil and slightly creamy, without being too salty. Overall, I enjoyed the flavor. This was a good balance as I'm usually not a fan of overly creamy ramen broth, and this was done much better than a certain other ramen place in LB. The order came with pork (or choice of chicken or tofu) green onions, soft boiled egg, spinach, seaweed and bean sprouts. Those who like spicy would enjoy The Blaze, or Spicy Tonkotsu option.  Extra noodles are available to order too.Grand opening Monday 9/30 at 11am! Plenty of parking at LB exchange. Believe they are also having another soft opening tomorrow 9/27.Checked their website which says more locations to open in Cerritos, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa. Really glad more good eats are popping up in the LBC! Keep 'em coming."
"Always satisfied when we come here! We usually order The Classic (with Tofu added), The Blaze, and Chicken Karaage. All this for a little under $40 (with tip added). We love all the flavors in both ramen bowls especially the broth! The pork belly is thick, flavorful, soft, and juicy! The portions are very filling as well! Our new favorite place to go!"
"Delicious ramen, really enjoy the pork its very juicy. Very consistent service every time."
Hi Lisette!  Glad we’re able to provide you great food and service during this time.  Thank you and take care!
"My husband and I came across this location while checking out the new LBX center. It just so happened that it was their first day of soft opening!! The line moved pretty quick and everyone seemed just so excited and happy that the store was finally opened. Great and simple menu. The decor is classic modern with very comfortable furniture and a solid patio. Mixture of warm wood, stainless, dark floors, clean finishes. Also there is a huge hand drawn mural on the wall. I ordered the Tonkotsu with pork and my husband the shoyu on fire. We also got the karaage which is their fried chicken appetizer.  Wow the food was amazing and the broth for the tonkotsu was perfectly rich and creamy. Shoyu was clean and ""refreshing"" if that makes sense. The food took a bit to come out, but it's totally understandable as it was their first day and obviously the crew needs to get the hang of things. It was awesome to see everyone in the back working hard, talking to each other, working hard. Overall, for anyone reading this post, be patient with the speed of the ramen as it takes time to create that masterpiece. Everything will be ok. Enjoy this new addition to LBX and the city of LB."
"I go back to my first memories of Silverlake Ramen and read my review then. And sadly, I have to report this new experience was underwhelmingly mediocre. At the entrance forms a queue, get to the register and order. They'll give you a number and you'll go find a seat. When we realized no tables were open we stood looking around, making eye contact with some of the staff but no ""hop to it"" action until I stopped one of them on their tracks to ask. But a table opened up because the people sitting at the table of 4 was just waiting for his to-go order. So he and his son got up, allowing us to take the table.Anyways, I missed the crispiness of the pork belly as I so fondly remember. I had the Shoyu - it was good, but nothing special. A simple bowl of ramen. Thin noodles, not my usual favorite, but chewy. Broth was a bit oily but flavorful. The boys had the Tsukemen and had the same thoughts. Wasn't the ""best Tsukemen I've ever had"" experience he remembered. It's nice to have them in the area. Unfortunately, it's not going to be our to-go."
"ALRIGHT! The wait is finally over, here at LBX! Got in here on their soft opening today 9/26 [Grand Opening Monday 9/30] Okay, enough talk, let's get to the FOOD! So I started with their Pork Bun (marinated pork belly,  pickled onions, aioli, green onion) and guess what?! it was BOMB! Then of course I got the ramen! So I had The Classic tonkotsu -- that broth was so rich! And say no more, all you have to do, is try it!"
"So I decided to follow my heart and I was not disappointed. Although it might be on the pricier side and the wait is a bit long, it was well deserved because the food was solid. I thought the atmosphere and their shirts were pretty cool, I defintely need a bunch of those ASAP! Best of all, that Steven guy and the rest of the team were very accomodating and helpful with everyone despite it still being a soft opening.But the real mvp was the chashu, I could literally eat it by itself. Great place for families and parking is abundant in the back. Plus, the cool part is I can burn some calories by walking over to tastea for some milk tea! Overall, awesome ramen joint."
"When I walked up and saw the line I was hesitant if I wanted to wait. Even as I waited in line the staff were very nice and answered questions. The place isn't very big so expect a wait to get a seat. The staff hustle but be mindful they just opened so things aren't perfect. So why am I giving them five stars if they aren't perfect yet. 1. The food was amazing 2. The Staff was attentive and responsive3. If mistakes were made the staff not only apologized but went out of their way to make each guest happy. If the goof was a major one they gave a nice discount or comped people's meal. (Don't try to get over on them, I can tell they really want to have gold star service) 4. The chefs personally check in with customers and not just if there is a complaints. 5. Tell value your business and show it In a few weeks this place will be a well oiled machine. So don't sleep on it. The ramen is damn near on par with the Torrance area (true ramen aficionados will know what's up. )The only tiny note I have is that the chatsu (pork) isn't as tender as it needs to be, however even with that it was flavorful."
"I was excited to try this place after hearing such good recommendations from friends and family on the LA location. It is located in the Hangar with plenty of parking and a good amount of seating. The space is clean and inviting with lots of windows for great natural light. This is an order and seat yourself establishment so service isn't a big factor but I did order and receive my food very quickly. Price is about average for ramen in this area.I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen with pork (chashu). The broth was light and subtle in flavor but was a good consistency. Noodles were firm and on the thicker side. The pork was very okay - thick and fatty but unable to soak up the broth as much as I'd like. Overall, it was very okay. It wouldn't be my first choice in ramen but I wouldn't say no to coming here again."

"I usually don't write reviews right away but after reading all the bad reviews, I feel compelled to leave my review from yesterday to serve them justice (as it seems like the owner really takes the time to read the reviews and really make improvements accordingly). So we came here for lunch yesterday (Saturday 10/19). We came right before they opened at 11AM and to my surprise, there were already people waiting outside. We were seated quickly and the order process was easy breezy (you order first and get seated later). We ordered the classic and spicy TONKOTSU ramens, pork bun, chicken karaage.. and beer. While the bun and chicken karaage were okay for me, I loved their classic tonkotsu- it was not bland, not too oily, and the portion was big that all of us had to take ours to go lol. Great service and nice vibe! I'm really happy that there's another good ramen place in LB. Please keep up the good work and I hope you guys will get better and better!"
"Good mirror to take bathroom selfies in 5/5But seriously, one of the best broths I've had in a while. Not too salty or creamy, but enough flavor to give you a kick. I do wish my ramen was firmer, need to see if they have that option available next time I go."
So I've been waiting for this place to open for at least the past three months. Super excited to have another ramen spot close by but I was a little let down.The service was quick considering reading the other reviews. But the food was meh. The broth was almost cold and the noodles were soggy. On top of that the pork was so thiiiicccckk that I couldn't enjoy it. But the egg was AMAZING! Perfect soy egg with the most perfect middle. Also got the chicken and it was ok but the sauce was really good.
"Yummy place! Good ramen in LB when I can't go to my ultimate ramen place Tatsu ramen in West Hollywood. This place is busy! You have to time it right if you want to be sat right away. If not no worries, they try and move  fast! I got a Spicy Tonkotsu ramen and it warmed me up. It had flavor and did not need anything  by added. Service- waiter forgot our waters, forks and napkins. Maybe we asked for too much?"
Tried out a new ramen place in the area and probably won't be back. Came with my best friend and we waited 30 minutes for 2 bowls of ramen and a small chicken karaage order. The original tonkotsu ramen was decent 8/10 but the spicy tonkotsu was 3/10. Chicken karaage didn't taste that great 4/10. They were just fried pieces of chicken cut small not like traditional Japanese tasty karaage and they needed to work on the dipping sauce. No bueno. My best friend was unlucky and got a raw piece of chicken ...I would just go to HiroNori on Carson in Long Beach or Kitakata in Buena Park.
"A big bowl of ramen tastes damn good from the comfort of your booth on a rainy day.  The food here is amazing I got The Blaze and the Fried Gyoza.Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen (The Blaze) is a deeply flavored broth with enough spice to warm the stomach. Go with the pork belly (other options are chicken and tofu), with chunks damn near the size of a standard pork chop!Fried Gyoza these pork dumplings have the perfect crunch, the flavor, and the sauce to make them a must-order."
"Silverlake Ramen is freaking solid.I am a ramen snob. I am a bit picky about the broth and the noodles. I've been to a lot of ramen places in Orange and Los Angeles county and it's actually pretty hard to find legit ramen. Thankfully, Silverlake Ramen is legitWalked in during lunch time, ordered at the counter, took my number and sat at their community table. Yes, the line was long to order, but the place was PACKED so basically just waiting for people to finish their meals. Basically same concept as writing your name down and waiting for a table like their original restaraunt in LA. I started off with gyoza and they were very tasty with the perfect level of fried. I looked up and saw the chef in the back hand making their dumplings! I usually only get their blaze ramen because, well, it's the best. Today I thought I'd try their shoyu ramen, and it was delicious. It has a more clean and light taste than the tonkotsu style. Thank Jesus I work 10 minutes away so I think I'll be here pretty often."
"New ramen place in the area! Hoorayyyyy! My partner and I were originally going to try the Silverlake Ramen closer to Los Angeles because I had just landed in LAX, but I found this location closer to home when I Yelped. Note: by the time we arrived at Silverlake Ramen it was 9:20ish - a pretty late dinner for me, so I didn't want to order anything heavy. Once you enter the restaurant, there's a line to the right where you put in your order and pay first. There's two kiosks available (pretty neat and first time seeing one at a ramen place!) and a cashier as well, but unfortunately, when we went, they were experiencing some technical difficulties with their kiosk systems and with their cash register as well - something related to credit cards. It took at least 10 mins for the cashier to ring up the group of two in front of us. During this time, I tried using the kiosks, but that didn't work out, so it took around 15-20 mins in total before we were able to get our order in. I know this is totally not anyone's fault and it's most likely out of their control, but it was still a little off putting, so I took off 1 Star for that as it's still part of the whole experience. Maybe the kiosks is new and they haven't fully gotten the hang of it yet. I don't know what the issue was, but I do have to give credit to all the staff for being professional and aiding us through the process.We both ordered the vegetarian ramen. It came with avocado surprisingly (a first for me), but that adds a slight creaminess to the broth. The miso broth is rich in flavor - light and fragrant! The tofu and kale is more mild, but with the broth, it balances out really well. My favorite ingredients has to be the brocollini and mushrooms! Those were so yummy. And last but not least, even though we don't get to adjust the firmness of the noodles, these were chewy - just how I like it! Big portions and was so satisfied by the end of it. Would totally recommend and I'd like to come back again sometime. Hopefully by then, their kiosks would be running without any hiccups!"
"This place had its grand opening roughly a week ago and my party waited for roughly 30 minutes before we placed our order with the cashier. We then picked up a number and chose a table to sit. We ordered the Three kinds of mushroom with butter, The Classic, and The Shoyu.Three kinds of mushroom with butter: As the name suggested, it came with eringi, shiitake, and enoki mushrooms. The dish also came with mixed spring salad which added an extra layer of texture with the sautéed mushrooms. It was a good balance between savory and light saltiness.The Classic: We chose pork as the protein and the creamy pork broth was very rich. The pork and the broth complemented each other well. It was a good sized portion of ramen and everything is fresh. Ramen was a good texture and one should definitely not wait to eat them because the noodles can suck up the broth very quickly.The Shoyu: We chose chicken as the protein to try out the different proteins they offer and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. The broth was made with chicken broth with shoyu--I found that it was refreshing compared to the heavier broth of The Classic.We did encounter a minor hiccup when The Classic took slightly longer (~30 minutes after The Shoyu arrived) to be served. We had to check in with one of the waiters and inquire what had happened with the order. The store manager, Steven, apologized profusely and made sure the order got to us quickly. He also ensure we left happy and got us the Crispy Chicken Karaage on the house. (Thank you, Steven!) So we have an added review on this appetizer!Crispy Chicken Karaage (small): The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It came with a slice of lemon and the spicy aioli sauce. Personally, I enjoyed the lemon juice way more than the sauce. We both felt that the sauce was overpowering the taste of the fried chicken. If you do get the appetizer, feel free to try both for yourself ;)It was a good experience overall--I look forward to coming back again in the near future and try out their other ramens!"
"Delicious delicious ramen! The ordering process for a sit down restaurant is a little different. You actually order and pay for your food when you first walk in and then you are seated. I ordered the spicy original ramen and my sister got the tsukemen ramen. Both were super delicious and flavorful. I got the medium spicy level and it definitely has a kick to it! My sisters tsukumen was SO flavorful. I loved both dishes. The only thing was that it is a little pricey, but I do see the quality in the food and the service is on point! Parking is ample and you definitely can spend the day in LBX shopping after getting your ramen fix. I would definitely come back!"
"My hubs and I came during the Sunday lunch rush with a fairly large group of six. There was a bit of a line, but it seemed to move at a good pace. You order first, and then get seated. The staff was quick and moved the tables around to accommodate us. Once we sat down, the food came out pretty quick! We started with some appetizers: gyoza and crispy rice w/ spicy tuna. Started off well with both. The gyoza was perfectly crisp and juicy and you can never go wrong with the crispy rice w/ spicy tuna. I liked that it wasn't overly drenched in sauce, but there's enough on the plate to get some more if you'd like. I got The Blaze (spicy tonkotsu) w/ corn added on. I always get mild spice to be on the safe side, but they have self-serve chili paste on the tables to kick it up a notch as you please. It really wasn't that spicy so I'm sure I'll get the medium next time. It came out piping hot and the egg was cooked to perfection. The broth was very flavorful, creamy, not too salty or bland. It paired perfectly with their crisp ice cold beer topped with special foam.Overall, good portions, good service, and we all left satisfied! I had always wanted to try the one in Silverlake, but never got around to it so I'm glad this location opened! Definitely will be coming back :)"
Loved the ramen most especially after landing from a long flight. Chicken broth for ramen was new to me and loved it!
Thanks for the review.  Take care.
Review is for take out vegetarian ramen order.Vegetarian ramen.Broth had decent flavor and had the right amount of saltiness. Was not spicy at all so you will need to add your own heat.Noodles were good. The mushrooms were a disappointment just regular cremini or button-not sure. Would love to have shiitake and or enoki added in.Greens were ok but felt like a salad mix.Broccolini was good and enough tofu and corn.Never had avocado in it before and it was a nice addition.Side sauces.I asked the  cashier if I serve my own side sauces or do they put them in. She said she would add them and asked what I would like. Ordering food: You use a touch screen monitor when you walk in and it's right by the register so very tight. You have to use these kiosks for dine in and for to go.Don't get to order from a live person so if you have questions or need recommendations you will have to ask the cashier and hope there's not a long line to wIt to get their attention. The cashier was very helpful when I had her attention. Parking : Plenty but it's in a shopping center so right spots and crazy drivers. Seating is pretty typical. Tight and hard chairs. Service that I had was friendly.Price with tax and tip was almost $17. Way overpriced for what you get. I get a way better veggie ramen at Wok n Roll in Long Beach for way cheaper.
"First time trying Silverlake Ramen and I ordered the Blaze ramen. The pork and broth was bomb  definitely recommend getting that. On another note, good ambiance and cool staff. Would definitely come back!"
"I came on a Sunday around 12:30pm lunchtime, and yes I had to wait around 30-40min in line to order my food. But what do y'all expect when coming to a ramen joint, especially a place like Silverlake Ramen? It's quite shocking after reading some of these reviews complaining about the wait time...oh and this place JUST OPENED. Go figureService: I really appreciated the service my party received during the lunch rush hour. We had quite the large party, but they were more than willing to accommodate us after ordering our food. Combining available tables and seats, we easily sat down thanks to the manager at the store. We also did not wait long for our food to come out, so I'm hoping those that did wait for 30min+ can chalk it up to the grand opening; I'm sure they will improve over time. 10/10Food: we ordered the blaze (spicy tonkotsu), fried gyoza, pork buns, and crispy rice w/ spicy tuna. They all tasted as I remembered it to be from the original Silverlake in LA. Broth is well-seasoned, creamy and flavorful. Noodles are made perfect (hard, not soft for you noobs). The pork belly was tender, but a bit dry. However, the pork in the pork buns were perfect. Overall, everything tasted fantastic and can't complain. 10/10I will definitely be coming back. If you truly want a great tasting ramen experience, do yourself a favor and come to Silverlake Ramen."
"First time at this spot and it was okay ... 5 out of 10 on my scale. My wife had to send back her ramen because it was cold and the chicken was also cold. She then found a blue rubber band inside her soup. YIKES ! Just watch out when eating here. I got the spicy tuna bowl, safe bet."
This is pretty much the best Ramen in Long Beach area. Looks like they just opened and they aren't really efficient yet. You can either order from a cashier or two machine kiosks. The cashier girl kept asking people in the line if they would order alcohol or not. Ones who want to get alcohol need to order from the cashier. They could easily organize guests and clear the long lines. They haven't figured that out yet. That was the only negative point.The flavor of the Syoyu Ramen was excellent. It's good as good Ramen in Tokyo. Someone has been working hard to make this soup and noodle. I chose pork as my meat. It was thick and very flavorful. I wanted to try their gyoza but was sold out.I will def come back and try other thingsCongratulations to this beautiful new business!!
My girlfriend and I came to this place for some ramen. Long story short this place is amazing. Fast service and friendly staff. U craving ramen? This is the spot.
"First time here and I'm a bit disappointed, only because I've heard such good things about the original location in Silverlake. I ordered the spicy tuna with crispy rice ($5.95) and the vegetarian ramen ($12.95). Spicy tuna was good, but only comes with 2 big pieces. The ramen was okay... maybe if I got the original ramen I'd have better things to say!The veggie miso broth was flavorful and I loved the various toppings that came with it. As for the noodle, I prefer a chewy noodle; these were pretty soft with no bite.Overall, this is good ramen but I think if you want authentic ramen, Shinsengumi is much better!"
"Just OK! The wait wasn't too bad despite the long line and the ramen itself was good. Our issue was the lack of organization and confused behavior of the hostess/waitress. It was almost like she didn't work there and randomly got assigned that position. They also didn't have a lot of dishes by the time we arrived although it wasn't late into the evening. Lastly, we were a group of 7 and it was difficult to find enough seating for all of us. I don't think we'll be back for a little while."

I love coming here! This is probably my 5th time coming here. Their customer service is great! I always get their tonkatsu ramen with extra pork slices on the side because i love how juicy and delicious their pork is. The server was very attentive and explained to me in detail about the menu. The soup was very tasty and flavorful
"Mhmmm, first time here, & WOW! Yummy! I ordered the Blazed Ramen (Mild) and a pork bun with a sprite. The staff was very friendly. Portions are big, got full quickly and took of the rest of the Ramen home, even reheated it was still as delicious as when I first got it. (:"
"Another great restaurant at the Hangar! The Silverlake has few items on their menu, you choose your protein to create the perfect ramen! It was not very busy when I went, so my food came out very fast. The workers were  very friendly and there were many seating options. I am definitely coming back!"
"Ramen here is so delicious! I had the classic tonkotsu and the broth was sooo creamy. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth soft. My mom had the pesto ramen and it was very unique with a strong pesto flavor. I usually don't like chicken, but I tried hers and it was so tender and flavorful that I might get chicken instead of pork belly next time. You order at a kiosk, so it's easy and fast. The kiosk is really built out so you can customize your ramen as needed and don't have to wait for a waiter to take your order. I'll definitely be back."
Ordered the tofu veg bowl. Not again. Wayy too much rice sticky rice... Sloppy made. Overpriced for just so much sticky rice. Sorry but facts.  The table behind me that day was also complaining because they had messed up on their bowl order and did not make it with the seasoning amount needed...so the worker told them that they could add the spice and told them its such and such scoops....the table then tasted their bowl and it was too spicy....   im not understanding what the mess up was that day but the service and food was not up to game at all.
Ordered the tofu veg bowl. Not again. Wayy too much rice sticky rice... Sloppy made. Overpriced for just so much stcky rice. Sorry but facts
"Food is great but a bit pricey. You order when you get in either with a person there or via a screen. There is no waiter and no table service but they bring the food out to you. They still expect to be tipped 15% if you use the screens to order. Hey, I don't tip the guys at UPS, the post office, the grocery store, Costco, the cafeteria for simply ringing up my order. So that is a bummer and therefore a lesser rating."
"Been wanting to stop and I finally got a chance to try the ramen.Ramen-I got the pork shoyu with tofu and ordered the handmade gyoza on the side.  Mmmm, not bad at all, better than all the ones in the area.  Thank you for NOT putting milk in the broth!   Milk is a bad trend.Gyoza-Handmade!  Need I say more.  Ok, I'll say more...I got it grilled, but you can get it fried.  Trust me grilled is the best (my preference). Ocha-Tea bag and hot water.  Good and I'm sure if I wanted more hot water I would just ask for it. This was my first time, but I'm going back for sure.  If my review changes, I'll make an update. Interesting thing, I noticed the to go ppl got numbers (a card with a number on it) and when we ordered (eat in) we didn't get anything but the receipt.  Wonder what happens when it gets super busy."
This place exceeded expectations. The food was delicious and the service was awesome. The servers were very polite and helpful. The music and atmosphere is a great vibe !!!! This is probably the best Ramen spot in the area with great customer service and delicious food.
"Looking for the ""silver lining"" in ramen?  Then no need to go all the way to Silverlake, just go to the Long Beach Exchange aka LBX and park your fuel efficient vehicle to fuel your stomach at Silverlake Ramen in Long Beach!  I ordered the Pesto Chicken Ramen which was a new flavor to their menu and this was definitely a new flavor versus the traditional ramen.  Think of a creamy chicken soup, but with pesto sauce instead and huge slices of chicken breast which packs a flavorful broth that will have your taste buds cheering ""Ra-Ra-Ra Ramen!!!""  My husband ordered the classic ramen which was very good and added extra slabs of pork belly at an additional cost which was money well spent for the portion of meat that you get.  We also had the crispy karrage chicken which had a hint of spice that was different from the traditional karrage chicken.  The restaurant is a pay first at the cashier establishment and also has outside patio seating available.  There are servers available who are very attentive and nice.  So if you want ramen that isn't too far of a drive if you are in the LB area, then go to Silverlake Ramen, it's on a corner and you can't miss it...you want don't want to miss this!"
Tried this new ramen spot in the LBX shopping center.  Ramen was very good with huge servings.  The broth was flavorful.  I had the vegan one and my husband got the blaze.  Would have given 4 stars because of the food but service needs some work.  They're definitely going through some growing pains and learning curves.  Payment issues. ordered apps and got it after our ramen.  Practically no service in terms of water refills or just to check in.  I'd definitely come back but will wait a few months til they're settled.
"The Classic Tonkatsu ramen and Spicy Tonkatsu ramen was delicious!! The broth was the right consistency and flavor!!! No marks missed!!  Rich yummy broth, just how it's suppose the be!! Pretty close to the ramen in Japan!!I'll definitely be back! Thanks Silverlake Ramen!!"
"The ramen is good, the meat is a little dry or whatever. Anyway, to the business owner, I think you can change things up. Primarily, when people enter the restaurant. There's this long line, and they order through the cash register who, in my past 3 experiences so far, all have been bad. It could be that they feel rushed since there's a line forming so they're not as friendly. Maybe, change it up where they seat you, and there's a waiter/waitress to help you instead? At least add some good customer service to it.Ramen is good. Fair price. But this is why HiroNori rocks. Service is great, and it gives that ""authentic"" feel while you're eating Ramen."
"Been dying to try this place. Came in Sunday night at 8:30 to order the Tonkatsu. So ready for the creamy pork goodness. I was told they ran out of pork...what!!!?I mulled ordering it with chicken but just couldn't do it. Sorry guys, invest in a little more pork. Less expensive than creating angry customers. Or never customers."
"OMMMMYYYY GAAAHD their broth is unreal!!!!!!!!!! So rich and luscious. If you're in need of a rejuvenation potion their soup will get the job done. Every slurp brought me back to life. #droolpoolDont forget about their pork belly slices either. THICK and JUICY! If bacon and steak had a baby, it would be born at this place. #meltinyomouthI read some negative reviews regarding service, but I didn't seem to have any issues. Their whole team was attentive and moved with a sense of urgency. I think these wannabe food critic yelpers need to take it easy. They just opened!! #cutthemsomeslackPS. Their take-out is legit. I had to to-go an order for my hangry GF, and was about the face the wrath of going without her, but thanks to their legit packaging I was saved and the queen was satisfied. #feedherordie"
"This place is pretty good. And I'm coming from NY, where the ramen is off the chain, so that's saying a lot. I got the veggie ramen and the taste of this ramen wasn't fishy which is awesome. The broccolini was also the perfect balance of crispy and delicious. The only real con that might keep me from coming back is the music. It's loud inside and outside, and it's not good. This is particularly a big thing for me so if this isn't something you care about, def go here. For me though, the Taylor Swift playlist was way too cute and poppy. Mix up the music a bit? Some LB hip hop? Tupac? Or maybe LB's own Sublime? I'd even take King Hipster himself (Silverlake...hipsters...anyone?), John Mayer. Anything but the bubblegum hits, please."
"My usual ramen spot was out of broth today so I decided to try this spot since it was new on yelp. I know Silverlake has been around for a min and is in LA area etc so I was thinking it might be the same. Oh okay, I was def wrong... was not the same. When we first walked in, it wasn't that busy, it was actually still their grand opening. We ordered and sat down fairly quickly,  took about 20 minutes for our food to come out. My boyfriend and I like to do initial thoughts at new spots we eat at, and we just looked at each other after our first taste of the broth. I really hate leaving these type of reviews, but the soup was bland. We both got the spicy tonkotsu, we dumped in extra chili paste and it helped a little bit. The pork/chasu was okay, it was fried on one side so you got that crispy taste but it def was a bit dry. The egg was good but honestly you can't really mess that up. Overall I'd give my meal a 3/5 star, possibly because they're new, they are rushing bowls out. I really don't know what it is but I eat a lot of ramen. Tajima, gu ramen, ramen hub, shin sen gumi, hori nori, you name it, I've eaten there already and I have to say we left very disappointed. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place one more go in a month or two when they are fully established try the pesto ramen so I'll update this again soon. Here's my run down:Food: 3/5Cleanliness: 5/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 5/5"
Thank you for your review.  My team and I will take your review into account going forward.  We are continuously working to perfect our broth at this location as well as the meat texture.  I hope we are able to serve you once again.
"Honestly; I hope  it gets better. If not, I much rather make the drive to silver lake for silver lake ramen. Went in on a Friday night. Not too busy. You make line, you order and pay. Then you are handed a number and you have to find a open table. The concept seems interesting, like a fast food joint. I didn't enjoy this because what happens if you want to order an appetizer, or extra noodles, or something else off the menu? You have to make line again? Mmmm no thanks! We (my boyfriend and myself) found a table for two outside. We sat and waited for our food and drinks. We usually just get water when eating ramen. Our drinks came around, we waited maybe 20-25 minutes for our food. Thats somewhat a bit of a wait for ramen. But the couple next to us had waited 40 min. When some ramen came through the door and in our direction I assumed it was for the couple next to us because they had been waiting. But we were wrong, it was our order. We felt so bad because we got there after they did and they had been waiting. We apologize to them because we felt bad and we had just asked them how long they had been waiting for and now we had our food before them. Alright now the ramen was ok. Soup was good in flavor, warm but not hot.  They really didn't read our order. We removed some items from our ramen... like the bean sprouts, the seaweed and the black pepper oil I thinks it's what is called. Sure enough everything was on there... the bean sprouts the seaweed, and the oil. I'm glad we weren't allergic because that would have been bad. And we wouldn't dare send it back because that would mean a longer wait. NO THANKS. The whole time we sat there, our drinks were never refilled and we had to flag down an employee because there were no spoons on our table. No employee bothered to come around and ask how everything was going. I get that it is a new restaurant and new employees but if you are going to be a silver lake ramen you have to live up to those standards. Like I said I hope it improves because I much rather go to this one since it's closer."
"Delicious ramen, excellent customer service, great atmosphere! We ordered The Blaze spicy tonkotsu ramen and chicken karaage bowl. Broth was creamy and flavorful and the cha su was tender and delicious. The chicken karaage bowl was amazing too! Love this place and definitely will come back!"
"This is Not ramen! The noodles were slimmy, ramen noodles are made to not get slimmy in broth. They are using regular noodles, so why am I paying for ramen when they are using cheap spaghetti pasta?  Also the broth was so bland and room temperature. It smelled like over salted pasta water, tasted pretty much the same,  salt. Even after I added chili paste. Very disappointed in quality of soup. There are better places go for ramen, that serve either their own made raman pasta or buy them from SUN noodles (factory in Compton)."
"I have waited years for them to open. Every day i looked out my work window at the building.. like a dog watching his owner pull out of the driveway. It may never rain in long beach, but it rained in this flashback. But today they opened their doors and we rushed in for noodz. I may be fired for telling the meeting organizer i had to go and hanging up.  The rain lifted and i froggered across lakewood blvd.I walked in and ordered classic because im white and not very adventourous. The portion was great, and everything tasted wonderful. I am not sure how to order more noodles since you pay first. I guess i can stand up and yell Send noodz to the kitchen but my co workers stopped me before i could.10/10 would vote for president"
Thank you for your kind response.  Looking forward to serving you again!

"I've been to this spot many times and have enjoyed my meals every time. Unfortunately, my trip today was not the best. I went in and ordered takeout for the first time. I ordered The Blaze with chicken and no green onion. They pack their takeout in two containers: one container with the broth and the other container with the noodles, meat, seaweed, etc. When I opened my food, I saw a bunch of green onion. In addition to that, the meat was pork instead of chicken! I didn't want to make another trip back to the restaurant to inquire, but I was in shock. The pork was a little fatty, but luckily I still enjoyed my meal. I'll still come back, but most likely won't order takeout again."
"Looks like the team here is learning and trying to get things together 1 star for service.Talked to a lady to sat 40 mins to wait for a to go ramen and some gyoza. The guy came out with gyoza in a plate and she told him it was for Togo when saw him went around the corner and used bare hands to grab the gyoza into the to go box... @.@Ramen broth was too salty. Although the restaurant wasn't full, it took 45 mins from ordering for the ramen to get to us...3 stars for food."
"Good evening, I’m sorry you had a bad experience when you made time to join us here at Silverlake Ramen.  As we continue to work out some kinks at the store, I will work with my team to make sure everything is properly handled.  I would love to invite you back for a better experience."
"Dunno why there's a lot of bad reviews. I went in on a Friday afternoon around 2-3PM! Looked kinda busy but I was ordering for take out. I received my order within 10-15 mins. I got a tonkotsu ramen, and mind you, I NEVER go out my way for ramen because I've had crappy ramen multiple times. I also ordered a pork bowl, which was for my bf. I got home nuked it up because. I like my soup PIPING hot, I'm probably from hell . Anyway, I added some more spicy stuff because also like my food super spicy. the verdict? I really liked the broth. It wasn't super salty like how SO MANY ramen shops make it. Examples: most of the ramen shops in LB. it's tasty! The pork was a big chunk of meat which I wish it was cut up into smaller slices lol. But it's the first Japanese style ramen that I finished on my own. I never really finish my ramen because I get tired of it, or it doesn't taste good. SO I LIKE IT. My bf also liked the pork bowl. But I'm going to japan next week so we'll see how it lines up with the authentic Japanese ramen"
"Great food, great customer service, great music. I  will be back. I got the Veggie Ramen so good!!!"
"To ramen lovers and employees: tonkotsu is pork bone broth, tonkatsu is panko pork cutlet...say it correctly, you owe it to Japan for both of these gifts.   Noodles were bad, my tsukemen was bad.   There's better elsewhere, unless you think Chik Fil-A serves a  great chicken sandwich.   Silverlake is Momofuku in NY, trying to capitalize on the ramen trend with hipsters ten years ago.   Remember, tonkotsu rhymes with so-so-soup, which is Silverlake."
"For long beach, this is the premier ramen spot. At night the service was relatively fast and the spicy pork broth had me down to the last spoonful."
Nice addition to the LBX. Broth was good without being too salty and greasy. The pork is a little crispy and tender.  Service is above average. Go ahead give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.
"You are talking D E L I C I O U S!! I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen with Pork. There seems to be other meat choices, but why would you have it any other way? ""TON"" in TONKOTSU means pork... duh! The ramen soup was so flavorful without any greasy or salty taste to it. The amount of ramen in the soup was just perfect. So instead of ""chashu"" or slices of pork, mine came with a good 3 inches of boneless pork rib stewed and seasoned just right. It was soft to the bite and flavorful as well. To my vegetarian friends, they do have ramen for you as well. Will be returning.... and I did!! This time I brought a friend. She tried the Tonkotsu and I went for the Shoyu Ramen. Based in chicken broth with Shoyu flavor, what an original FLAVOR it is! It was DELICIOUS!!!! Ate and drank the whole thing!! Hands up the best ramen experience!!"

"It's really a 3.5 but i'll round it up. I got the Classic and the soup base was really good, the noodles were ok. I usually like my noodles on the chewy side but at least it wasn't soggy. The pork was a bit chewy though which I didn't care for, but they got the ramen egg down. I came with my husband, his brothers and niece and the brothers really liked the ramen (probably cus the soup was good) and it was spicy enough, and as they would say it ""it's better than ramen hub."" But tbh, I didn't like Ramen hub anyways, so... it was obvi that it was better than Ramen hub. So they do have chilli paste on the side if you want your ramen to be spicier."
"I'm so glad they opened in Long Beach, I no longer have to drive an hour to get good ramen.If you've been to the original one you already know the deal. This location is just as good. Clean, fast service, good servers, can't ask for anything more."
"Haven't even tried the ramen yet but I am already disappointed. The line to order food moved pretty quick but the wait for the food... Not so much. My wife finally received her bowl and 10 minutes later... Still waiting for mine. Apparently my order got ""messed up in the system"" and I'm still waiting while my wife's bowl gets colder and colder. Service is bad and I'm not sure we'll return with other quality ramen spots in Long Beach.Edit: I'm adding an extra star for the delicious broth, however, the pork was a little more tough than I like. I'm a sucker for that melt-in-your-mouth chashu. Didn't get it here. Also, don't waste you money on spiciness like ""The Blaze."" The tables come stocked with plenty of chili paste to spice things up to your liking."
Best ramen I've had in a while in the area. Unique tasting brother and ramen noodles. Service was great. Like that seat was controlled by asking patrons to purchase food first.
"Tried Silverlake Ramen (SLR) in Long Beach about two weeks ago. It's a very attractive, modernist ramen restaurant located in a newly renovated food and entertainment gathering area of Long Beach, near the airport. It was a cold evening. We were seated near a side door which opened to the patio seating area. As the wait staff and customers came and went out to the patio, the door would swing open, followed by cold air which would blast onto our table. The room was loud due to normal customer noise, not loud music. The waiter arrived and immediately informed us they are out of chicken for the evening -- at 6:30 p.m. for G0D's sake. My now vegetarian ramen was supposed to be spicy. It was indeed spicy, so much so the dish was burning rather than tasty. I am used to and enjoy spicy food, but there is a difference between simply burning hot spicy food versus the judicious use of ""hot"" spices to make a tasty, yet spicy dish. This was spicy hot, just to be spicy hot -- uncomfortably so, I might add -- not tasty. I sent it back. The others at my table liked but not ""loved"" their ramen.  Here is my suggestions: 1. Install sound baffling devices to reduce ambient noise. 2. Install a second door corridor or a heat blowing device to create a barrier of sorts between the patio and the first table at the doorway.  Perhaps not seat anyone near the patio door when it is cold outside. 3. Be sure to order enough chicken to make it through the night considering your business is based on selling chicken-based ramen in addition to pork. 4. Improve the taste of your product, you have a lot of competition for business, you need to be on your game to provide an equal or better product. SLR failed in that regard. Do better, improve, its not too late.  I would give the place one more try, they may have had an ""off night."" But, as it stands, SLR is as average as one could get for ramen in So Cal...sorry but that's my story folks."
It was good! The ramen that is. We went before the grand opening knowing we would experience some issues. We didn't. We ordered and paid. Found a table and got our waters. The ramen arrived in about 20 minutes. It wasn't too hot and really good! My kid got the classic and I ordered the blaze with mild heat. It was spiced just right. We will be back!
This shit was delicious. Very silky and creamy . I normally can't fit that much in my stomach but it was so good I almost finished it . Yum
"My Wife and I first time here,  we ordered the Classic tonkotsu Ramen, the pork broth is awesome! Can't really go wrong with a Tonkotsu, really tasty for about $12+ a bowl it's decent and I can't complain, I recommend this place ,we would definitely come back."
"Silver Lake is always a good option for ramen!  But it doesnt compare to the OG location in Silver Lake LA. The broth is one of the best creamy broths you'll ever eat if you like heavy Tonkotsu.  The noodles are good too, not too firm like Hakata-style, yet not too soft like Fukui-style. What makes this place worse than the original is the chashu is over cooked, the chicken is too soft and limp, the portion sizes are smaller, the egg tastes like the put soy sauce on it literally right before they put it into our bowl, and the service is really slow (though you order from a kiosk, so that evens out). This place is still great, and I would come back since its a great location and great parking and the name great broth and noodles I love. I would highly suggest you try the original location if you love this place!"
First time at this place and I loved it! I had the pork ramen and it was delicious. Great addition to the Long Beach Exchange!
Great atmosphere and perfect location but most importantly great tasting food and exceptional service. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with warm and friendly smiles. I highly recommend this place if you want great food and service.
"It's a cool little place. I've had ramen numerous times but I got the spicy shoyu bowl. I broke out the next morning, I did not know they use wheat noodles. I called the manager and he apologized and let me know if he could do anything. So I did like his gesture."

"Being around the area the other day and was craving ramen. This was one of the first place that popped up so we decided to check this place out. I ordered the classic, which was just a regular pork bone broth. Flavor of the broth was good but the pork was the money maker. will be coming back."
Mediocre and overpriced! Most who like this place probably have never had good ramen and lack a valid basis of comparison! Skip this place and go to Ramen Hub on Atlantic for lower prices and better food!
"We attended their soft open after developing a die hard attachment to the ramen at their original location. It. Is. So. Good. Y'all.As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a decent ramen broth, and their veggie broth is fan-tas-tic. I add a little gyoza sauce for the tang, and some chili and boy howdy. Yes please. The service was great, everyone was working hard to give us a great experience. Support this business!"
"Oh my goodness so gooood!! It's order first, seat later. I am curious how this order first and seat later will work once business starts picking up. Given all the issues with OG silverlake, it can be over an hour to be seated before you can order. There's also a not-yet-in-service kiosk to order food so that will be interesting as well. There's indoor and outdoor seating so I believeeeee it's dog friendly? It's very clean, modern, the typical ""rustic industrial farmhouse"" look that all restaurants have nowMost important part: RAMEN. It's super delicious and pretty the OG location. I ordered the shoyu ramen with chicken. I would they would also maybe grill the chicken a little because it's literally a slice of a white chicken breast.. no flavor. Luckily the broth, ramen, and egg made up for it. My SO got the tonkatsu and he demolished that bowl like it was his last meal he'll have for the week. We ate here on a Monday for reference. I usually am not able to finish a whole bowl of ramen but I too demolished that bowl.. aside from the chicken pieces. We also ordered the karaage which was super juicy and came with a side of this spicy aoili sauce. I would definitely recommend! Bonus: it's super close to some dessert places so if you're not feeling all blown up and puffy like Violet Beauregard then there's a tastea or pop bar to satisfy that sweet tooth. Or force your SO to walk around Nordstrom Rack to walk off the calories... :D"
"Got the blaze tonkatsu ramen and spicy tuna. This place has potential but my boiled egg was cold and the tonkatsu was room temperature, and didn't have the best texture or flavor. Don't come in with high expectations. There's room for improvement. Having said that, I'd eat here again. 4 stars seems about right."
"I was super excited to have Silverlake Ramen come to LBX but that quickly faded after eating here. First, the layout is off. Whoever designed this location did not know what they were doing. You walk in to a sign that says ""click here to see the menu"" but it's just a regular sign. Um, that's a bit weird. Then a handwritten sign taped to the top of a railing says, ""order at the cashier."" Ok. So, you are a new location and you have a handwritten sign to tell your customers how to order? What? Literally every other business in the area has this part down. Best part, all the menus are on the tiny hostess desk, and you cannot get to a menu if ANY other customer is ordering. That's just stupid. There are several white menu boards on the wall, so I assume the young girl that took our order will be out of a job once they get the computer ordering up and going. Food...food was blah. Tonkatsu is usually delicious and full of that rich bone marrow taste. This broth, not so much. This tasted bland and thin. It was like the broth was thinned out with milk or something. I ordered the Blaze Hot, level 3, their hottest...it wasn't hot. I made the mistake of ordering chicken as my protein. Bad, bad mistake. The chicken should not have been served. The breast had woody breast, a condition that happens when chickens are put to slaughter too quickly and raised to get too large. The meat has the texture of uncooked meat but is cooked. It tastes rubbery and off. So, long story, passed on the chicken. Thank goodness I ordered extra egg. The egg was delicious and cooked perfectly. Last, the noodles. The noodles were a mess. Basically, a thick blob of stuck together noodles. Sorry to say, I will not be coming back. There are too many delicious ramen places within 30 minutes to come back. There is no excuse for serving inedible chicken. If you put ramen in your name, I expect a lot. Unfortunately, Silverlake Ramen fell short"
It was my first time trying this spot out. It was recommended to me by my parents. It's a small nice spot to eat at in Long Beach. I ordered the blaze and it was good. Personally I don't like it tasting heavy on cream and this plate is definitely that. The portion is a good size portion. The prices are affordable and the service was overall good. I will come back to try other options
"This location of Silverlake Ramen is a little more spacious than their other location in LA. There's a bar area, communal table and a couple handfuls of tables with an outdoor dining area as well. The customer service was great. All of the servers were attentive, gracious and very apologetic. My friends and I waited a little over 30 minutes for our meal. This was sort of expected because when we first walked in we saw plenty of tables with patrons that had that look of hunger and impatience on their faces. As our food came out we noticed that our eggs were hard boiled opposed to soft boiled like traditional ramen should be. We asked if the kitchen would be able to remake it but they declined. My friends and I didn't make a big deal of it because it's just an egg and I'm sure the kitchen had more to worry about. The broth was creamy, noodles we're all dente but overall the ramen wasn't anything to rave over. A solid 7/10 for us. The ramen here is very similar to HiroNori in Bixby Knolls. Good, not great!"
"I've been to the original Silverlake Ramen and was excited to see one open up way closer to me. I remember the broth was super rich and creamy and the meat was fall apart tender the first time I had it. I ordered the original tonkatsu and liked the broth, but the pork was a little tough and chewy. Hopefully it gets better the longer they're open. My friends enjoyed their chicken karage bowl and shoyu on fire ramen."
"Thank you for your honest review.  As we continuously work on perfecting our broth and meat texture, I hope we are able to give you a better experience should you give us another chance.  Thank you."
"It's a small place but they are very quick and friendly, ordering take out is only allowed online. They do not take phone orders since they cannot charge you over the phone."
"Had a bowl of The Blaze spicy tonkotsu ramen. Before mixing in the spice I tried the broth and it was tasty, the added spice hit the spot for me. Not crazy hot but hot enough to enjoy the flavor and heat. Pork was fine but I have a preference for a more tender preparation."
"I tried to go to Silverlake once before and it was overcrowded with no room to wait, and there was a strange food smell. We ended up leaving, but today I decided to give it another chance alone at a less busy time. There's a bit of a bottleneck near the front and the ordering process was a tad awkward, but once I got my food, everything was fine. I ordered shoyu ramen with chashu and black garlic oil on the side. The chashu was thick and tender, broth was savory and delicious, the egg was perfect, I thought it was surprisingly great! The bamboo was quite good too, though I felt there was a bit too much and some of it was a bit tough, and I thought the noodles were just passable compared to the rest of the dish. Feeling a bit mixed on the overall experience, but in the end I think I would definitely come back for a local ramen fix!"
"We welcome new restaurants into our arms and neighborhoods wholeheartedly.....with exception to restaurants  who are ill prepared to handle a regular lunch rush..As patrons we do not wish to hear why you have over a half an hour wait at noon on something as simple as ramen .If you cannot as management and ownership prepare for what is to be expected as a lunch rush then in our case you will have no less than  groups of three and four people (15 people in total) leave an go elsewhere.It is enough that YOUR ESTABLISHMENT has overpriced what most would solidify as a a dish that one should not pay any more than $7.50 for and publicly upped that price point to $12.50 and then have the poor excuse upon entering you establishment  and hearing from your staff's mouth the excuse that you cannot deliver a single meal without a half an hour delay....with empty seats in plain view.If and when you want us to definitely over pay for a good bowl of ramen  then please provide the excellent and expeditiously warranted service that all  patrons deserve.""Excuses are nothing more than tools of incompetence"" All patrons deserve a better response than the one that you felt so comfortable in giving ."
"Silverlake has arrived in the LBC!! This was my first time at the Long Beach Exchange and it's a very cool plaza with lots of shopping to do. The place was packed when we arrived and the air was filled with the sweet aroma of pork broth. I ordered the pork tsukemen and bae ordered the classic ramen, and both were very good. They were so generous with the pork portions!! Very attentive waiters too.Come check them out if you're in the area!"
I've only had takeout from here so far but I enjoyed it! The ramen broth is the tastiest that I've had in the area. Takeout was a good size and placed in a nice paper bag. The only thing is that it got a little less hot but that could probably just be fixed by eating in next time. It is a little pricy but the taste makes it justifiable.
Yo this quarantine shit isn't a joke. We ordered off Ubereats and our designated person went to pick it up and then these people decided to cancelled our order. We waited 40 minutes just to get our damn food cancelled last minute like y'all couldn't let us know earlier? Fix your damn Ubereats and all the other pick up delivery food apps you have going on. Wasting my damn time and shit
"My family came here on a Sunday at 12:30. You wait in line to order and pay before they give you a number and seat you. There is only one cashier so if there's a line it will move pretty slowly.  We ordered the to tonkatsu ramen, pork rice bowl, and chicken karaage.  The broth was delicious, noodles yummy, but the pork in the ramen and pork in the rice bowl was dry, thick, hard, and not really flavorful. I had one slice of meat in my ramen that was thinly sliced and tender but then I also had like 3 big blocks of dry pork. Not very appetizing.  The chicken karaage is delicious though! Regarding service, our orders came out incorrect and when we pointed it out to the guy who brought out our order he just stood there and didn't say anything. My husband then said ok thanks and he just said ok and walked away. I mean at least apologize! Geez! We also had to get up and get our own to go containers bc the employees were just too busy to see us all waving our arms out for attention. I'll just attribute that to them getting their system down since they just opened."
Love Silverlake Ramen. I've been to their original location a few times and I'm so glad that they opened one a lot closer to the OC area. Their broth is so good you can tell it took time to make it. It tastes just like the original. I usually get the spicy tonkotsu with pork. The chicken kaarage is a must get as well crispy on the outside and and juicy with great flavor.
"I was so excited to see a ramen shop opening up so close to me and I'm happy to say it lived up to my expectations. The broth is so flavorful and they have a lot of extra toppings to make it exactly what you want, and I'm impressed that everything comes out looking like the pictures."
"EAT WITH CAUTION. ENTIRE PARTY WHO CONSUMED FOOD GOT SICK WITHIN HOURS! The restaurant was clean and packed full with employees... so the reason we had so many problems at this establishment is beyond me. First off for the amount of food you receive, this place is greatly overpriced. Employees do not have enough knowledge of the menu to even suggest items. Everyone was extremely nice, but again, the lack of experience was very apparent. We got an order to go, took the food back to the house (2.5 miles); by the time we arrived home, the food was ice cold. There was no possible way that it was even warmed in the first place. The portions were absolutely tiny (at 14.99). I called the restaurant and the employee stated ""don't worry. It happens all the time. I can refund you meal..."" Fast foreword two hours and my entire family is sick. Having debilitating stomach cramps and other symptoms. I have worked in the food industry for over 15 years at senior levels and will be reporting this restaurant to the health board."
"Good evening Sean,I am so sorry to hear about your experience.  Upon looking into your order, I noticed you had order our Tsukemen which is traditionally known as our Cold Dipping noodles.  The noodles are prepared fresh in our noodle boiler then ice bathed which results in cold noodles served alongside our hot broth.  We encourage our guests to reheat their broth if they’re taking it to-go.  Edamame don’t necessarily stay hot as they travel either.  I noticed your full meal was fully refunded as well but this has never ever happened to any of our guests."

Finally Long Beach has bomb ramen.  No more driving to Torrance or Gardena.  Highly recommend the black garlic..
Silverlake Ramen is my favorite! My husband and I have been driving out to their sunset location for years! So glad it is now closer to home & we no longer have to worry about the parking and far drive anymore! Everything is delicious.I came in lastnight for the soft opening and also today for lunch! We will def. be back soon
"The best ramen I have had. It was popular when we went to dine there the other night and very busy, but if you don't mind sitting outside or at the bar area, then it was fast. I ordered the vegetarian option and it was absolutely delicious and the perfect kind of food for when you're feeling under the weather or just plain old tired. I was that day feeling tired, so it perked me up. I would say you get your monies worth for this ramen, as I was so full when I left. The flavors and the veggies were perfect and will definitely be returning soon while the weather is cold."
Love the Pesto Cheese Ramen and the chicken was moist and delicious. Although it's a long wait for the food to be served.
"Came in on a Thursday night around 7 PM, took awhile to get our order. Maybe it's cause they just open recently but the ramen was average at best. The blaze was tonkatsu broth with a spoon of chili paste on top. The tsukemon ramen broth was cold enough that the fat was solidifying on top. Overall, I was very disappointed at this location compare to the Silverlake location."
"Came here with my coworkers during our lunch break. This location's ordering process is a bit different where you order and pay first before you sit down. I personally prefer this method especially for work days.My favorite ramen is definitely the spicy tonkotsu. However, it is a bit spicy so I would recommend the regular tonkotsu if you cannot handle the heat. As for appetizers, I highly recommend the pork buns and the crispy chicken karaage."
Ummmmm ... I am Japanese so picky about ramen. I ordered Tsukemen but The soup taste is very strong.The soup taste is very strong.But The pork is thick. But I prefer Tsujita noddle tsukemen and Ramen is better. And they don't bring water and Renge spoon . And 2 ramen and 2 green tea then we pay $50. It's too expensive
We really wanted to like this place. Way over priced..We won't be back. They have an ideal location for business but 20 bucks is ridiculous.
"Vegans and vegetarians, go get it. The vegan ramen is fantastic. You won't be disappointed."
One of the best ramen I've had. The service here is wonderful and the broth tastes really good. I would come here again soon !!
"Tried the Shoyu and Tsekemen. I don't normally eat the creamy broth but this one is not too bad. Meat was soft, ramen is good texture, and I like corn in my ramen. $13 a bowl is a low price for ramen nowadays."
"One my go-to's for ramen in the LB area! Their chicken wings are delicious and they come with a spicy creamy sauce that pairs really well. As for the ramen, I have only tried the spicy tonkatsu. Very creamy and the spice level is just right for me. The pork is tender and basically melts in your mouth. I have eaten at their LB location and also done takeout and have no complaints about the quality of the food."
Came here on a recommendation.  Seems awkward at first due to their weird kiosk system but service and food definitely made up for it.  Ordered some pork buns along with a blaze level 2 ramen.  Broth wasn't oily as I was expecting which Is fantastic.  Very large portions for the pricing.  Will definitely be back!  Great service to top it off.
This is by far my favorite ramen restaurant in Long Beach. I've been going to the actual Silverlake location like for 2 years now and have tried ramen all over LA and still keep coming back to this one. I now live in SGV and brave an hour long commute to get to it but it is all worth it once I take a sip of that rich broth! My go to order here would be the BLAZE SPICY LEVEL OVER 9000!! MAKE YOU SWEAT BABY
"I know it's their soft opening and they're still working things out, but my experience was disappointing. We waited in line and when we finally got to the cashier/hostess, she told us she couldn't seat us because we were a party of two and she only had ""party of four tables available"". It was ridiculous because the three groups behind us in line were party's of two. Why wouldn't you seat us just because we are two people? What, are you going to wait until a large party comes to seat them even though we've been waiting in line to sit? Not to mention, they had about 3-4 tables open that hadn't been bussed yet. After a little persuading, she finally took our order and we found a seat.We finally sat down and for a good 20mins no one came by to bring us or offer us water. They were running around and busy, it's a soft opening, I get it. The thing is we were sitting near the drink station so I decided to ask a server if we could get some water and she said that ""you are next in line for water, we don't have anymore cups""..... I was extremely confused because she didn't even bother to look underneath the counter where I could VISIBLY see that they had tons of cups. She was taking cups from people who were finished eating and waiting for them to be washed to then start giving people water. It got to the point where I was debating about pouring my own cup of water. We ordered at 8:18, the ramen got to our table at 9:15, so it took about an hour to get to us. We ordered the chicken karaage, the classic and the blaze ramen. The ramen came out first and it was good, but nothing special. I've had better. We were basically done with our ramen and we still hadn't gotten our chicken. We asked two people about it's status before it even got to us. I'm pretty sure it was forgotten. You could tell it was rushed because when they served it to us it looked nothing like what I'm use to and I've been to other Silverlake Ramen locations. It was basically just a ball of chicken that was stuck together with weird clumps of gooey batter. So gross. I had to double check the photos on yelp to compare. We ended up sending it back and getting a refund. Overall, the experience was just underwhelming and disappointing. I really hope they get their team together because that's not what I expected from a place with such hype."
I sincerely apologize about your experience and will work to train with my team to prevent future issues.  I hope we get a chance to give you a better experience in the near future.
Legitimately the worst service I've had this year. It took 45 minutes in line to get an average bowl of Ramen. They need to get a better system down to seat customers during the lunch hour. Lost my business forever and I will be sharing with friends
"Terrible customer service We walked into the place behind one other couple, they told the hostess there were 4 more in their party that would join them after parking. No problems we took the menu and stood there  patiently as all 6 ordered.  Being next we stepped up to place our order only for the cashier to inform us the previous party was the last customer of the night? Lady I've been standing 2 feet away,  you couldn't have said that 10 minutes ago when I took the menu from you? Yes you're right that's the last time I try to be your customer."
"Ordered 30 minutes ago and I still don't have my bowl of ramen. I never had to wait this long for a bowl of ramen ever. If I were you, I would hold off eating here until they fix this problem. Seems like they're still trying to figure things out."
Was craving soup and stopped by. Service was good although Ramen noodle was not your traditional Ramen noodle. Seemed more like eating spaghetti submerged in a broth base with spaghetti that needed to be cooked a tad bit longer.  Broth base was delicious although my taste buds were not anticipating the rest. Not the worst Ramen cuisine but certainly not the best.
"My sister went in to get us seats but she was asked to leave her seat and order first. My sister was not going to eat but just accompanying me, hence she was told to wait with me in the line. We just took our business elsewhere."
"Hi Shiloh,Unfortunately at full capacity, we will ask our guests to not hold seats as it is unfair for the guests who are in line ready to order."

The ramen is ok (Hiro Nori and Taejima are both better) but why the heck are all the people working the floor Asian while the majority of the people working in the kitchen not Asian? What's with that??
"Gross. Ordered chicken, got ""I think it's pork"". Fatty, tough and smelly. No offer to make it right by the staff when I expressed concern. Skip it, for sure, or good luck!!"
"Came here on a Friday night for dinner and was not disappointed! I used the self-kiosk (you can use when you pay with card) then headed over to the cashier to be seated, pretty cool and basic. The food was exactly as I remembered from Sunset location. Classic Tonkotsu ramen broth was creamy and delicious! There is chili paste on every table so you can make it spicy to your liking  I love my broth spicy! And they serve beer!!The staff are very attentive and friendly , deff coming back!"
The pork belly was so thick and dry and didn't taste like it was seasoned. Very disappointed. The temperature of the ramen could've been hotter. It turned lukewarm very quick.
"Yooooo straight up I haven't been on yelp since forever but I download the app just to make this review...if you love the silver lake ramen in Los Angeles like I do...you should've been  happy when you found out Long Beach was getting one so you wouldn't have to drive all the way out there, just here to save y'all some time...don't bother coming here! The ramen quality and portions are nothing like the silver lake ramen out in Los Angeles...I came with my brother one night excited just to be let down completely, I ordered the normal chicken karage and the blaze....first of all why ask me how spicy I want it if you're not going to make it to my desires, chicken was aight. So after this I was like ehhhh they prolly had an off day. Decided to give it another try today and lemme tell you, big fucken mistake! Never coming back again"
One of the best ramen spots in LA! This place is honestly so underrated. The Classic Tokontsu is a must! It is so rich in flavor and the broth is one of the best ones I've tried. There can be a wait at times but I guarantee that it is absolutely worth it!!!
I've been to many ramen restaurants and I alao have my top picks. I am including this place! I enjoyed my classic ramen with tofu. The soup was so tasty. My husband's shoyu w/pork was good too. Customer service was great and the servers were pleasant. We had a lovely dinner.
"Maths best Raman I ever had!! Great service, absolutely delicious!! My family loves to come and dine in! Definitely will be back!"
Good food and huge bowl of Ramen. I love that they brown the pork belly! You can also  add extras to make your own signature ramen. Nice modern store with outdoor seating. Great service! Also have clean restrooms.
"This place is complete amateur hour, you have to wait in a. 20 minute line while the super slow girl up front takes your order.  This is while the restaurant is only 50% full.  The self order kiosk is ""down"" and when asked why they say because the restaurant can't handle the volume"
"I've gone to this place quite a few times.  Every time I come food hasn't disappointed me at all.  They give a good portion, place is small but clean.  It normally stays pack.  Customer service is always friendly and attentive."
"I wanted to love this place so badly since it was right near my house. Unfortunately, it left a lot to be desired. Number one their noodles are very thin and although it's a personal preference, I do like an option for the thicker noodles. Number two, if you order a beer it will come in a small glass filled 75% of the way to the top. But I'll save the worst for last number three, if your signature dish is called The ""Blaze"", perhaps it would be a good idea to offer drinks with refills. it blows me away that these restaurants think they can get away with offering Coke diet Coke and Sprite all in cans. How about a fountain drink with refills. No seriously get rid of the cans and get me a fountain drink."
Hands down BEST Ramen EVER. I got the classic with pork. Broth AND noodles are amazing. Super creamy and great flavor. It's like a hug in a warm cozy blanket in a bowl.
"Service was great.  Young lady at the front helped us with ordering.  Spicy ramen and Tonkatsu ramen broth were both meh.  Noodle was overcooked, but the pork pieces were really good.  Pork bun was so dried out and I sent it back after taking a bite.  The second try was too soft (over-steamed) and due to excessive sauce, it split in half after first bite.  Crispy rice with tuna was good.  The helpful server lady refunded the pork bun which was not necessary but appreciated.  There are many better ramen places in LB for me to give this place another chance."
Was excited for this place to open! Always looking for new ramen places! Tried it with some friends and the hospitality was incredible! It was very crowded and loud but they did their best to help everyone in a timely manner. Apple beer (non alcoholic) was very yummy! Had the vegan ramen and bowl and they were both amazing! Large portions of ramen as well!
First time at this ramen place and so far it is  a promising go back place to be. Service is great; staff are friendly and food is good. Hope it could keep up with the influx of customers.
"OMG I've been waiting for this place to open! So easy to order and my ramen came out so FAST! And out of all, the SPICY tonkotsu ramen was soooooo BOMB especially the spiciness was so perfect and the broth was NOT greasy at all like other Japanese ramen places. I would definitely take my coworkers next time I go back. Perfect for my one hour lunch break!!! **Side notes: the staffs were so nice and helpful even with the long line of customers**"
"The place was small but there was great seating. When we get there we had to wait in line to order prior to seating. If you're new with ramen, this might be a little intimidating just because there's a line behind you.  Our food came right away. I ordered the veggie ramen and inquired why was it ""vegetarian"" and not ""vegan"" and girl that took our order said "" it's the same"" UMM, no it's not but okay. I asked if there was any animal product and she did say no. The ramen was amazing, the broth was so good with  good options of veggies in it. The bowl was huge for the price."
"Hi Gloria,We use vegan ingredients for our vegetarian ramen, however we don’t have separate equipment or take the extra steps to certify it as vegan."
"Used to go to the original shop in Silverlake, tucked into the corner of that tiny plaza, slurping up delicious bowls of tonkotsu late at night. When I found out that Silverlake Ramen was coming to Long Beach I was stoked! As for this location, it has all the classic stuff from the original, spicy tuna over crispy rice, pork buns, the classic tonkotsu, etc.  The tonkotsu broth is as creamy and delicious as always.  Definitely will be coming back here for my ramen fix from now on!"
We love our ramen spot. This place is delicious. I recommend the blaze woth tofu. He eats the pesto cheese. yum yummy yum

"I love Silverlake Ramen! I am new to yelp and don't have too many reviews but I felt inclined to review this place. I've been waiting for a while now for this place to open. Great food, great location, and great service. Time to gain some weight!"
"Just tried it out with my wife and have to admit that 3.5 star review on yelp is a lie. Ramen was great! We had the pesto and the classic and both were of great quality. We normall frequent ramen hub almost on a weekly basis and have to admit that the quality in this place was much better! Broth was delicious, ramen was perfect consistency and very thick pork/chicken slices. Will.come back here more often than ramen hub. Plus: Outside seating is amazing"
"One of the best ramen, not too salty like most ramen places. The line is line is long for ordering, but this is cafe style so know what you want before you get to the front of the line so you don't hold up the line for other people."
"This review is more about management. The ramen was good, but when my buddy and I came for the first time yesterday we ordered two bowls of ramen, a pork bun and edamame. Everything came out except the edamame. I told one of the waiters about it and he said he'll look into it, but never came back. My buddy and I ended up finishing our food and decided to ask management to cancel the edamame. Management was apologetic, and not only did he cancel the edamame but also gave us the pork bun free on the house. It was great customer service and I greatly appreciated that. Will visit again because they have a pesto ramen that looked really good."
I've been to a few ramen places and this is definitely one of the best ones yet. Great service and amazing food.
Love this place. Been here twice already. The only thing is... shoot me... no please don't.... it's a little salty. Not toooo salty. Just a teenee tiny bit.
Service was REALLY bad. Good service is our number one priority when we go out to restaurants. We were excited for this place to open up near us and were disappointed. You would think service would be outstanding considering they just opened.  We go out to eat many times a week but this one sadly won't be on our rotation .
"Good evening, I am sorry that you had a bad experience.  If you can message me and kindly elaborate on what went wrong, I would greatly appreciate it."
"Probably the worst service I've ever received. We were seated pretty quickly, but it took 45-50 minutes to get our food. I also had to ask the waitress 4 times for my appetizer and every time she would go back and say she was checking on it but wouldn't give me back an update. As we were packing up to leave was when our appetizer came out. We had to ask them to pack it to go. I don't think we'll be coming back here again."
No stars.. waited 30 mins and still hadn't received our order!!!!!!!  We were TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED
"Ordered (2) The Blaze and a Soboro bowl. Ordered at 8:16 PM and the ramen came out within 5 - 6 minutes. The Soboro bowl on the other hand didn't come out until 8:52 PM and it was for my 18 month toddler. Asked a couple of times as well before it finally came out. Both times I was told they were working on it. Food was good, but service is lacking."
"I am very disappointed. We were being seated next to the door by this guy server and I requested if we can have the booth because it will be cold when the door opens but the server said we are trying to reserve that for group of people which it only sits 4 people. Before our food gets served, I saw 2 people starting to sit at that booth I requested and I called the server and asked him why do you have 2 people now seated at that booth and gave a vague response and walked away and did not bother to come back to us and say sorry.  I am sure he mention this to other host or server.  I saw the lady server with a yellow apron just kept looking at us even when we left.However the food runners were delightful in bringing our food and even checked up on us."
"Nightmare customer service. When we ordered ""tsukemen"" at cashier, we requested to make noodle to be hot. We made sure twice, but what we received... hot soup with cold noodle. We requested a server, Kevin to bring hot noodle. His response was, ""did you order that? This is served with cold noodle"" with nasty attitude. We know. That's is why we requested when we ordered. That how Japanese eat ""tsukemen"" with hot noodle! He told us that it would take 7 mins and only to bring noodle. So... he was asking us to put topping on side. While awaiting, soup was getting cold... when he brought ""hot"" noodle, he didn't even say words with attitude. We lost our appetite completely. It would never ever happen at Japanese Ramen Place. If you don't know what And how to serve ramen, don't even try. We were way beyond disappointed. We spend almost $50, but want every penny back!"

Broth was a bit heavy on the salt but everything was fairly good. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean.
"Not the best ramen I've had.. I went to the Long Beach location due to the hype I've been hearing about this place. I think it's just because ""silverlake"" is in the name.. lol There's better ramen spots."
"Been here twice now and it's been good. First time was ok. I had the tsukumen (dipping ramen)with chicken. The noodles were thick and chewy and the dipping broth full of flavor (pork and fish base). The chicken I had with it was just boiled chicken so nothing special but with the dipping broth delicious. Also tried the spicy ramen, which was the original just made spicy (pork based broth). The 2 slices of pork that comes with the ramen is pretty thick. The ramen is the thinner noodle which was a I felt was a little over done. Second time was better. I had the original, which I think actually tastes better than the spicy version and swapped out the ramen for the tsukumen noodle. You can taste the depth of flavor in the broth and not just the spice. If you want spice you can always add some at the table. The noodle also had a nice chew to itAlso had the shoyu ramen which is a little eh...(chicken base broth)."
"Always on the lookout for great ramen places. Took a chance on this place as I saw a long line waiting to order. I soon realized that the long line & wait time was due to the host/cashier walking away to chat with co-workers, drink water, or stand in the kitchen after every single person who ordered. This may have been on purpose to give the kitchen time to prepare or deal with a rush, but the tables weren't even full; this just looks horribly wrong to waiting customers. After waiting over 1/2 an hour in a standing line just to order takeout, they said that they would not be able to give it to me in to go containers separately, but that I would have to be seated & served and then pour it into to go containers myself. The food was just ok, so it was not worth the wait. Sadly disappointed."
A MUST GO!!! From the moment I walked in the staff was very nice and kept me informed on how to order as it was my first time. I ordered the Tsukemen and my friend ordered The Blaze ramen. BOTH WERE AMAZINGGG! The vibe and atmosphere was absolutely great and the bathrooms smelled amazing(some thing I never say about other restaurants). Great music too! Will definitely come back
"Was waiting for this place to open. You order when you walk in then sit down anywhere there is an open table. I order the blaze, wow it was good. Noodles were soft and broth was very tasty. There are side condiments on that table if you want to add more spice to your broth which I love. Very filling. Definitely will be back. Finally a good ramen close by."
"Phenomenal ramen, coming from a person who is very selective with his ramen!  Having gone to the original location, I was glad to hear they opened up a location that was closer to my job site.  It's a perfect place to bring friends if you're craving ramen.  Definitely swing by if you're in the LB area for this well-known establishment!"
"This place opened up not too long ago and I'm glad it did as there's a new ramen place that's close to home! I went in and tried the Blaze ramen bowl with pork and I was satisfied with it! I loved the rich, porky, spicy broth and the texture of the noodles as it had a nice bite to it! I tried it with the level 3 spice and it packed a good amount of heat once I mixed in all the chili paste. The pork served with it was great as it was a nice thick cut with a nice grilled char to it. I loved the casual vibe the place had as I felt that anyone and everyone could eat here and enjoy a bowl of quality ramen. I appreciated the cleanliness of the establishment and the attitudes of the entire staff including the kitchen! I will definitely be coming back here and trying their other ramen bowls and rice bowls as I have high hopes and expectations for them!"

Service and ramen here are top notch.  I don't usually like ramen but Silverlake's quality has me coming back for more.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great ambience and great food.
"Second time we come to this place, first we waited more then 30 and the food never came, today we ask the cashier how long would it take, and they say our system are out so will take around 25 min. Sorry guys but for ramen place too much time of waiting."
"Very fast wait! Everyone is very patient and nice here. Glad I'm able to try this out at the Exchange. One server in particular, I think his name is Andy, he struck up a conversation to my group and he was so pleasant to talk to. Our experience was elevated thanks to his awesome customer service. We're definitely coming back"
"Lord have mercy, this is the best ramen in the LA / OC area. The food is amazing. Forget about your last ramen spot, this is your new go to."
9feb2020.  My first time here and ordered The Classic.  The broth was WONDERFULLY  creamy. I would have  been satisfied just having the broth by itself. It was  so tasty.
I went here on a quick lunch break and was not able to be served because there Kiosks were not working. Unacceptable in my opinion.
"Excited that Silverlake Ramen is finally open near my home. The wait time is long since it's a soft opening. But once we sat, our food came out pretty quickly.  We ordered the blaze ramen and we loved it. It's same taste as in the original store in Silverlake."
"Super hot new spot! Fast, efficient, friendly costumer service! The place was a random find for us but we will definitely be returning, food was so good. No complaints!"
This place was amazing! The Ramen was delicious and the staff was super friendly! The service was excellent from the time I walked in to the time I walked out. My family and I will totally be back to try more of that super yummy Ramen.
"The blaze (spicy tonkatsu ramen) is my favorite along with the 3 kinds of mushroom. The atmosphere is awesome and I enjoy sitting outside. My boyfriend also works here, so I might be biased but the waiters are very friendly (:"
This location is perfect! Everyone that works here is super friendly! Location is super clean and the food is to die for!
"Clean and with a courteous staff this Silverlake restaurant is good to dine in for a quickie. Their broth has a light creamy flavor that goes well with the meal. The ramen is not spicy despite being warned by staff that is it is. Fortunately, they have chili paste so it can be remedied. However, strangely enough I prefer their vegetarian option when I'm normally carnivorous."
"So excited to see a variety of food options @LBX. My husband and I went during their soft opening (Sunday afternoon). Everyone was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Classic Tonkotsu  with pork and the hubby had The Shoyu with chicken. Both were excellent. I preferred The classic with the creamy broth. My husband doesn't crave Asian food as much as I do and he was already thinking about our next visit. Looking forward to trying the bowls. Also, hope they add wine to the beverage list."
Soup is lukewarm. Taste is just like instant noodle.Ramen with lukewarm is bad enough to eat.
"When I heard there was a new ramen place opening up in Long Beach I was pretty excited, since there aren't too many out here. I tried the classic ramen & got a small chicken appetizer and they were both really tasty! The broth for the tonkotsu was rich and the pork belly was amazing...they also have chili paste on the side to make it spicy too! The appetizer was crispy and had a lot of flavor especially with the sauce on the side. The place is clean and gives off a very comforting/welcoming vibe. The service was good & they always checked up on us ! Will be coming back here again soon (:"
Ima keep it simple the ramen was great but the service can use a lot of work. Everyone on these stars is for that tasty ass ramen.
First time here and so far I like it! I guess they're for that fast food type of restaurant and it's pretty handy. The ramen itself is amazing and the service is very friendly. Would definitely recommend it. If I'm around the area I'll come back to eat here!!
A Shin Sen Gumi would have been great here. If you think this place is really good ramen...then you're probably super basic.
"Tried this place for lunch with a friend based on recommendations from several people and it didn't disappoint! Came here for lunch and the wait was about 15-20 minutes from the time we got there til we got our food. It was busy and I can only imagine the wait would get longer as the lunch rush gets more intense. The Blaze is PHENOMENAL. ""Soup""er flavorful and has just the right amount of heat to it. They have a vegetarian/vegan option as well that my friend enjoyed a lot. Very highly recommend this place."
"Silverlake ramen is in the long beach exchange, there is plenty of parking, you order before you sit, it was not too busy so I got my order pretty quick.I had the regular tonkatsu,Broth, is good not too thick, a little lighter than tsujita in thickness, it had mushroom flavor, kind of like cream of mushroom. Noodles, typical straight noodles, maybe a little thinner, egg, it's a half a soft boiled egg not marinated and the chau siu was grilled than put in the soup but it was a little salty. Overall it was good, the broth was different from what Im use too. I would try a different protein.I would try it again but a different flavor perhaps there most popular flavor, the blaze which is a spicy tonkatsu."

So stoked we have a Silverlake Ramen in Long Beach!!! Insanely delicious and super friendly service. Lots and lots of parking and not usually very crowded in my experience.
"The bomb! Just as good, if not better than the one in Silverlake."
"This ramen place is by far the best ramen I've had in awhile!!! Really simple and fast to order your ramen with great service!! I decided to stop by here for dinner and the taste of the first bite blew my mind out the window. MUST TRY their spicy tonkotsu ramen!! As an employee in dtla, where little Tokyo is walkable distance for lunch, I've tried many ramen places but this is by far the best place I've had!! I'd give this place 10 stars if yelp allowed to do so.. A++++++"
I enjoyed the food. It's good portion size ramen when I like. Definitely would come back.
The ramen was so good when I came here!  I got the blaze ramen with Kara age side.   The ramen had a deep flavoring with very savory notes.  The karaage was a good portion (I got large) and nice and crispy on the outside.  I'd definitely recommend anyone to come here!
I got the Blaze pork to go and I really enjoyed it! I'm thinking about going to try an experience in the location.
"Really good ramen! The broth is honestly amazing, I got a spicy tonkotsu with chicken & the chicken was super tender! I've also tried the pesto ramen, highly recommend. I'll definitely be back"
I think so far this has to be my favorite ramen place the ramen was so good and the broth is perfect especially for cold days all the ingredients were fresh and the workers were very friendly to me and my family I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys ramen!!
"Went on opening day here with a co-worker and yes, it's pricey. Ordered their classic tonkatsu ramen with extra pork belly & a craft ginger ale, total was over $20. I enjoyed it all however; noodles and broth were perfect, pork belly was just right, egg was delightful. Damn good bowl, would definitely recommend."
"Avoid this place, waited over 30 mins and food never came out. The person who came before us got their food before us . Will never come back, ended up getting a refund.  Wished I was able to give 0 stars"
"We were 2nd in the line but the cashier still pushed us to use the machine to order. The machine took longer time and didn't have the toppings we wanted, so we turned back to the line, at that time she has already started the order for the people behind us and the seats we wanted has been taken. Not sure why she did that to us."
Loved this place! We are big fans of ramen and Silverlake Ramen did not disappoint. You order at the front and they quickly bring your food out to you. The brother was delicious and egg was cooked perfectly. The pork was not my favorite but the flavor made up for it.
Nastiest place ever. My cup smelled like egg.. gross!! If you want good ramen go to shin sen gumi in Torrance. It's worth the drive from LB
I’m terribly sorry for your experience and I’m hoping you can message me about what went wrong.  I would love to bring this issue to our team so we can fix it.
Amazing ramen soup I got the shoyu fire it's super tasty. The service was awesome and friendly . Just wish they would of had sushi like in the original location but will definitely will be coming back
"Happy New Years Carmen!  I have some great news, we will be introducing sushi this upcoming week!  Stay tuned."
"There's a big flaw with their ordering system. We were directed to use the electronic ordering system at the kiosk but while we were using it, other customers were allowed to cut in ahead of us and order at the cashier. Due to this, we had to take a seat at the bar since all the tables were taken after having other customers cut in front. Im not sure if the hostess was trained to do that or what but it doesnt leave a good experience."
"Had the shoyu chicken ramen. Tasty broth and good noodles. Sadly, cold egg, cold bamboo shoots, and worst was cold and undercooked (visibly red) chicken! Won't be returning."
"""Subarashi"" as one would say. Truly brilliant. Came here at night, the vibes, truly cozy. The ambience, impeccable. Once Nujabes started playing I knew this was the place to be. Now the food, delectable. Simple flavors yet complex. Loved it. Eat here."
"What can I say. This ramen place exceeded my expectations. The food was great and the service was hospitable, almost like I could befriend all the waiters. One waiter in particular was very nice and accommodating, I believe his name was Andy. If you decide to come to this ramen place, keep on the look out for this guy. He'll take care of you. Overall a great experience would definitely come back"
"Came here for our first time and enjoyed the experience but wouldn't call it extraordinary. The ordering kiosks were not working but the hostess was friendly and helped us order. Once seated after ordering the girl who brings the drinks was fast and very nice. We ordered the steamed pork bun and chicken karaage  as apps. The chicken karaage was supposed to have ginger and some other toppings on top according to the pic and description in the menu but they came plain with sauce on the side. I wasn't a fan of those but my friend liked them. The steamed pork bun however, was AMAZING! My favorite thing by far, the flavor was different and just soooo good. The spicy ramen was good but the broth could have used a little something something.  My friend and I both ordered med spicy but Her ramen was def mild and came out at least 5 mins after mine when we ordered at the same time :/ some kinks to work out still but overall an okay place to eat dinner."
"We ordered Tonkotsu Ramen . The broth was too fatty & salty for us. And  the pork was not taste ,like a ramen hub  one .  The service is so rude . I guess this restaurant is owned by Korean , so they likes copy of  other Japanese restaurant .  That's good idea . They don't know how to make real ramen .."

I was there in their second day of soft opening and they weren't supposed to do a to go order but they let me do a to go order!! This spot will be really good. Just need more time under their belt!! Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen was good. Can't wait to try their other food!
I ordered to go. I felt the price was a little pricey for fancy ramen but they provided a descent amount of food in my order.  When I arrived home the food was still hot and not soggy and I enjoyed the flavor of the soup.
"I was super excited to hear that silver lake ramen is now in Long Beach. I've been here twice. The first time was in September 2019, party of three on a weekday night. Ordering was simple, the cashier took our order and we were given and number to take to our table (there were plenty to choose from). Food came in a reasonable time, it was delicious (although I would say the original location is better). Now my most recent visit was completely different. Came in on a Friday night, party of three. The line to order was almost out the door and not really moving.  Apparently they had allowed to many people to order food without having a table for them? We order, then wait about 10 min to be seated. Once dated outside, we were confused as to how the servers knew what we ordered since we didn't get an number for our table. A serve came to our table and asked did we order any drinks, we told them our drink order but were confused by how our food was going to get to us if they didn't know our drink order yet alone our food order. Maybe 10 min later one of our ramens came out. Then nothing for 15 min. Eventually the other 2 ramens came out buy my friend was already almonds done with hers! I had also ordered a side of gyoza which did not come until about 20 min after we were all done eating lol. I asked for a refund on the gyoza and they were very apologetic aBout it. Seems as though there is no organization on the managerial level, poor workers :("
Plain and simple - it ain't good. Very disappointed in this knock-off ramen that's wasting valuable real estate in Long Beach.
"I am providing this review since there are correctable issues.  We enjoy ramen immensely and it is in our interest to have  good ramen restaurants in our area.  So I decided to take the time to offer this review.It was our first time at Silverlake and my son ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered Shoyu Ramen.  My Shoyu ramen was barely warm.  The egg yolk was cold as was pork belly steak.  I went today because I had a craving but it was not at all satisfying.  No part of a bowl of ramen, whether it is the soup, vegetable, eggs, meat or even the bowl, should be served cold.  This is just amateurish.  The noodle was a bit stiff for my taste but I'll chalk it up as their style.  Aside from the temperature, I really didn't enjoy the 1/2"" thick grilled pork belly steak.  Shoyu ramen is a rather delicate  dish and the half-warmed stiff pork belly sitting in a lukewarm soup just did not do it for me.  I'd much prefer thin slices of chashu.My son did enjoy his tonkotsu ramen, though it was too spicy to savor the subtleties, if there were any.  On a separate note, there were no seating that I would have found to be a good table.  Each was either by the door, major aisle, or the restroom.  The two stars are for friendly staff and prompt service.All in all, it feels like the operators missed the opportunity to establish a good eatery in a popular new commercial development."
"The ramen was great when the wife and I tried it a month ago. Unfortunately, tonight the cuts of meat in our ramens were terrible: mostly fat and quite small. There's a lot of potential here so hopefully their quality stabilizes."
"My husband and I were looking forward to this after hearing good things, and since I had a sudden craving for gyoza, figured why not. TL:DR version -Recommendations for improvement: seating system, carry all menu items, keep utensils and napkin containers full, faster service.Positives: I am a positive person and I can't think of anything! MAJOR SAD FACE.Full version:Walked in and wasn't really sure where to go, we saw the line to the right and followed the line. Ordered at the kiosk, that was pretty cool, except they were sold out of gyoza. Ugh. We scanned through the menu, and there were actually a lot of items sold out, including their green tea (that's all I remember), but that was a bummer. We ordered chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, shoyu on fire. You pay everything up front at the kiosk or with the cashier, including tip. We're all paid up and tipped and sitting by 4:57pm.We sit at the table right behind the cashier, wait, five mins later or so, our chicken karaage arrives... there aren't any napkins in the utensil container on my table, so I get up and get it myself from the communal table... no big deal, we're happy... for now.They have a seating system where they match the ticket number to a table number in their system. There's no table number that you get, no buzzer, food just shows up. The problem with that is that the customer doesn't exactly know that, so it seems like we can move tables if there's a better option. I heard at least four conversations between the cashier and the server not finding the tables, and even a disagreement between the cashier and a server, with the cashier stating to a server ""well if they move what do you want me to do about it?"", in a very non-teamwork kind of tone. Not something I want to hear as a customer, especially since I'm sitting less than a foot away from the cashier (move that table or add a partition please), so I told the server ""hey, those customers moved to that table over there"". But yeah... at least four parties that came in after us moved, and I knew exactly where they moved to because I was waiting for FORTY+ minutes for my food. Not a single server came until I was finally able to flag them down after about TWENTY FIVE mins after the karaage came. And all those people that came in after us that moved, they all got their food before we got ours.If I didn't have to pay up front, and tip these people, I would've just walked out of there. But with the already super long wait, and not wanting to deal with getting a refund and having that be super slow and getting more irritated, we waited. Food arrives at 5:38 FINAL-FREAKIN-LY, and again, I had to get up cuz this time there weren't any soup spoons. Like seriously, I got here before the dinner rush, doesn't anyone check inventory? F***. The food portion was big. Lots of meat, which was nice to see. The pork belly in mine was thick... that's usually not a problem, but if you're going to have thick cuts, at least cook it until it's tender. Mine was tough, and I would've rather had thinner slices. Sure, portion was huge - for $12.50/bowl, it should be. What a mediocre experience. Silverlake Ramen should've just stayed in Silverlake."
"In Raman heavy Long Beach this is still a great addition.  The chicken Soup style ramen is unlike any I've had before, broth is rich and delicious and the noodles perfectly firm.  The outdoor dining is pleasant on a warm afternoon. Have beef twice and will be going back soon."
"Had very high expectations when trying this place out. We have tried many ramen spots in the past and were hoping to add this to our list of favorites. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Their line was out the door, you had to wait and order at the register before sitting down at a table. Kind of an odd way of doing things, but maybe it was supposed to make the dining experience easier? I am not entirely sure, so we ordered the tonkotsu ramen and a couple of beers. I kindly asked the cashier if we were able to order more beers after we sat at the table. He politely said no, and stated we would have to wait in the line to order another drink. That was unfortunate, but we still had a positive attitude and couldn't wait to try the ramen. While eating the ramen, the chashu pork was cut into huge slices and was extremely chewy. It grossed us out so much, that we pushed the meat to the side and finished the noodles and broth, which were delicious! May give this place another try in the future, but not likely."
"Pretty disappointed, I was really looking forward to the iconic thick cuts of tender pork that the original Silverlake ramen consistently provided. Just had their bowl of The Blaze, and the the two cuts of pork were very overcooked, hard to chew, and just takes away the overall enjoyment of the meal. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, but still compared to the other silverlake, I've eaten there a few times and never had overcooked meat."
"Good day Justin, I am so sorry you had a bad experience.  I will share this with my team as we continue to improve our ramen standard as we grow.  I would love to invite you back to try us again.  Give me a message if you are interested!"
"Weird ordering system but the food is delicious. Tried bao bun, gyoza , the crispy chicken was very good."
"Service was great. But the ramen was not it. I tried this place on opening day because I heard the other locations in LA are popular. I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was underwhelming. Service was good and the location itself is nice but yeah, their ramen is bland. No flavor, not even chilli paste could save it."
Tried the original. Broth is cream based and had no flavor. Only got two pieces of pork and barely any veggies. The overall dish was flavorless. Atmosphere is crowded and chaotic.
Super tasty. Great service. Veggie ramen is amazing with a generous amount of vegetables.
Came in on a Saturday. Food just average. Service is poor. I ordered and was seated at 9:03PM. First item arrived at 9:32 and the second one at 9:36. Restaurant was about 60% full. The other 3 Ramen restaurants within a 5 minute drive from this location don't make me wait 1/2hr for ramen. I will try this place in another month and see if they have their act together.
"Horrible. Waited almost an hour for a couple bowls of ramen. And the service was horrible. The servers were incompetent and didn't have answers for why the food was taking so long. All of the food was coming out at different times. And people who ordered after, got their food first. It definitely was not worth an hour wait. I'll never go there again. They should have stayed in Silverlake. They make you pay before you eat, and It makes sense because then people would leave for having to wait so long. Never again. Do not suggest."
I am so sorry for your experience.  We are continuously working on how to create a more efficient service system for our new store.  I hope one day we’ll be able to serve you in just that manner.
This was my first time trying Ramen! This place was really clean and had excellent customer service. I'm usually picky when it comes to restaurants but best restaurant ever and I should be back soon!!
"Usually really don't like ramen, but this place was straight delicious! The crunchy tuna was my favorite overall, going to be a regular!"
"Good food. Not a huge fan of the chashu, but the blaze ramen itself was tasty. The spicy tuna with crispy rice was really good."
The food is incredible. Very busy during lunch but certainly a gem worth waiting for. Food comes out of the kitchen fairly quickly considering how crowded it is. All the workers are friendly and helpful. Place is clean and modern. Definitely going back again.
