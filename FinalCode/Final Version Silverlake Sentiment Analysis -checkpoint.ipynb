       "\t<tr><td>I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "\t<tr><td>*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

       "\t I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

       "\t Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\\\\\n",
       "\t Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "\t *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

       "| I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

       "| Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow. |\n",
       "| Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

       "1 I have been here at least 3 times to dine in person. Hospitality was always excellent but service was always slow since they are always so packed.

       "2 I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3 I have been here twice in the last two weeks and it is yummy. Great service and awesome food and high quality. My family and I love Silverlake Ramen, double thumbs up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4 Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\n",
       "5 Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6 *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.

    "- Aside from the word \"ramen\", the next **most mentioned word is \"broth\" and closely following \"pork\"**, these elements of the dish **hold great weight in a good or bad bowl.**\n",
    "- Most common words: After food, **customer service and wait/time are the next most popular categories**\n",
    "- **Food temperature (cold) contributes to most of the negative sentiment**, whereas the opposite is not true at all. Hot food is not mentioned to the same degree as cold food is. **Food texture (hard/soft) is the next most popular category that contributes to positive/negative sentiment**\n",
    "- **Anticipation (time/wait)** closely followed by **joy** are the **emotions mainly displayed** on these reviews**\n",
    "- **Again**, for most common bigrams, **customer service is the next most mentioned category**\n",

    "\n",
    "   The amount of information that can be gathered text alone is endless. I can only imagine how great the effects text analysis can have on other topics/industries. \n",
    "   Thanks to computational power and online resources this personal project has allowed me to apply my skills in extracting information from text data. Overall, even though much of the findings were to be expected, **it is reassuring to see how the data is in line with my previous inclination as a ramen connaisseur**. The data shows why **broth and pork are truly some of the driving factors for a tasty bowl of ramen!**"
