The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection.

       "\t<tr><td>I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well! Â Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Probably one of the best broths for ramen that I've had thus far. There's a hint of roasted garlic in the tonkotsu broth that just completes it.You order and pay from kiosks in the front, then show your receipt to the host in the front who will seat you. There's a variety of seating options: the traditional table, high table, bar or patio seating. This makes it welcoming for parties of all sizes. We sat at the bar so we weren't hoarding a table from bigger parties. Maybe about a 15-minute wait for food at most, but that was because there were lots of take-out orders before us.We ordered a small karaage with spicy aioli sauce, the classic tonkotsu ramen and the blaze ramen. Like I said before--the broth was amazing! Noodles were firm and on the thinner side, and the chashu was a tender slab of pork belly that was to die for. For the blaze ramen, you had a choice of 3 levels of spiciness. At level 2, my boyfriend said it was still flavorful with a kick of heat. We highly recommend this place. Apparently there's another Silverlake Ramen in Silver Lake (yes, that was a \"no, duh\" moment for me). We just happened to stumble upon this location. There's plenty of parking in this mall and no wait when we came. Apparently the wait is ridiculous at the Silver Lake location, so just plan ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Decided to try a new ramen place. When first walking in, we were directed to the right to place our order. There is two options in ordering. You can either order on the touch screen or with the host. We opted to do the touch screen to see the set up. It was very easy to use however if you want to order quick and be sat quick then order with the host. About 3 parties after us ordered through the host and was sat before our order was submitted. We ordered a California roll and 2 Blaze Ramens with pork. The California roll was dry but the Blaze Ramen was good. We were pleasantly surprised that the pieces of pork were very thick and juicy. It was a bit salty but it went well with the broth. The noodles were on the thin side and were hotter bottom of the bowl.Flavor wise: The broth itself was creamy with a subtle flavor to it. For those who like spice, the spicy paste added a nice heat that wasn't overbearing. You can also control the amount of spice by choosing your option of mild, medium or hot. If you would like it spicier there is a jar of spicy paste on every table.Temperature wise: The broth was warm but could've been hotter and the egg was cold in the center. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very clean, modern and there was good music playlist. The restaurant is small but it seemed more spacious due to the ceiling being elevated and the amount of windows. It has limited seating inside but they have a patio area to make up for it. The staff was not too attentive other than bringing our food, probably because it was slow. On the bright side, most of what we needed was on the table. They had good spoons and good quality chopsticks, which if always appreciated when eating a bowl of ramen. We ended up sitting in-between both of the doors since it was the only seating available inside which kind of sucked because we got air coming in from both ways. Price: The bowls were on the pricier side. We paid about $40 for 2 bowls and 1 California Roll. Every side extra cost about an extra $0.50-$1.50It wasn't a bad experience nor a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>This place is located in that new shopping/eating center in Long Beach, right by the airport. My wife brought me here because we both love ramen. We were looking for a new ramen place too, since the one we used to frequent has dropped down in quality quite a bit. Not to mention, Silverlake Ramen has Tonkatsu brother that is deeper, richer, and tastier than any Tonkatsu Broth I've had so far here in the United States. By that, I mean to imply that I've also had Tokatsu ramen, at various other places, when I used to live in Michigan. The noodles are nice and thick, but not too thick. The egg is PERFECTLY cooked with the consistency being somewhere between soft boiled and medium boiled. I believe it has some kind of seasoning on it too, which is a nice touch. When I saw pictures of their Tokatsu on their Yelp listing, I got really excited because the broth looked really thick and milky/cloudy. That's usually a really good sign that the Tokatsu broth is REALLY tasty. Oh, and the pork is really lean, and less fatty than a lot of other ramen places I've tried.Anyway, 10/10, would have again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

No wait...Minus:1. the weird way to order (millennial-ish kiosk) 2. weird way to get seated (no one really tells you how the order, seating is supposed to work).3. Lack of \"service\"-no one really greets you after you sit, they just look at your receipt, drop your ramen bowl off.. then you are left alone unless you flag someone down for whatever your need.Parking: easy tons a lbx. Park by the tj max side.. easy/out.I really liked my ramen and gyoza! Edamame pass... micowave tasting beans and minimal salt..meh (you should do spicy garlic edamame!!I got:-the shoyu on fire level 2 spice with pork bellyThis was sooo delish! Clean broth, lots of umami. Â The roasted jalapeno, fresh geen onion, slab o meat, corn kernels all worked well.-great ratio noodles to broth (you can order more noodles on the side if you like stuffing your face with more carbs).-noodles were perfect. Â Bit of chewy.. not soggy.-the fire level was perfect. Â Keeps the hot in you mouth without worrying about gonna come out the other end the next day.We sat at the small kitchen counter watching the ramen cooking craze.Its a small space. Â Maybe sits 50ish people max, less tables more community seating.They seem to do a TON of take outs which is maybe why the in Â house service folks are distracted.We'd come back. Â Hope they work on their customer service a bit... would have given 5 stars of so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Based on the name of this place, I had a feeling Silverlake Ramen would have vegan options. Luckily their menu clearly states what is vegetarian and they also provide an allergen menu online so I can further research what is plant-based.The Veggie Ramen has tasty miso-based broth! I like that the presentation is very green due to the broccolini, baby greens, kale, and avocado. This is the first time I've had avocado in ramen. Not sure how I feel about that but I also won't kick it out of bed. There's also tofu, corn, and bean sprouts. Though you can't see it in my photo, there are mushrooms hidden under all those toppings. This dish is very noodle heavy which might hit the spot for some people. But I might ask if I can get half the amount of noodles next time. The day we came here, it was a particularly cold December evening so this soup totally hit the spot! bit.ly/2QxjVI3The Mabo Tofu Bowl was quite yummy as well. It is a bit different from other mapo tofu dishes I've had. Usually, I have the sauce mixed in with the tofu. This version has the sauce on top of the tofu. I loved the eggplant! The ginger was a nice addition and I love that it was topped with fresh green onions. I hoped that they had brown rice as an option but unfortunately they don't have it. But I'm hoping they might consider offering it in the future. bit.ly/2QOHmeMThe two times we've been here, they had a cashier taking orders. It makes me wonder why they have the self-service touch screens? I prefer customer service from a real person anyway. And they're friendly and helpful here too. Also, purse hooks at the bar-height tables!Plenty of free parking at LBX including charging stations for our Tesla :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>\n",

You order upon entry so it's quick-- no need to wait for a server or anything and your food comes out within minutes.I order the Classic ramen with pork belly and I could not get enough. The soup was the perfect amount of creamy and the egg was smooth and cooked just right. (My mouth is seriously watering as I write this). The portions are also super generousThe servers are patient and attentive and while parking can be tough, it is very worth the stop.

       "\t<tr><td>I came here on a Monday lunch and we didn't have to wait. You order at the kiosk or the cashier and proceed to find your own seat. We got the classic and the blaze ramen, the latter apparently being their best seller. You can pick the meat (we picked pork on both). We also ordered a pork bun on the side.The food comes out fairly quick. The broth is very creamy and thick - really rich ramen. The bowls have decent servings of noodles and soup and a thick cut of pork.I think that the classic and blaze have the same base but the blaze with the spice takes it to another level, so I would recommend this. The bun was ok - pork was excellent but I wasn't feeling the mayo.Overall not bad - I would like to try their gyoza or rice bowls next time just to try.Perhaps between 2 people one ramen and the others on the side would be enough, as I wasn't able to finish my ramen.Then again, it was lunch and i don't normally eat a lot for lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Feels like modern take on a ramen restaurant, down to the food choices, vibe, and logistics of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>I ate at the original Silverlake Ramen in Silverlake a few years ago, and loved their Veggie Ramen. I recall it being rich, flavorful, and creamy. The company has since rapidly expanded, and when this new location popped up in Long Beach, I was excited to try them again. We ordered delivery via Postmates, since we are out of their delivery range-they are located near the airport. This time, the Veggie Ramen was barely edible. The grayish broth was completely flavorless, and the weird assortment of veggies (broccolini, corn, huge chunks of undercooked soft tofu, avocado (?!)) had a bitter aftertaste. I love avocado as much as the next Californian, but it has no place in ramen. The noodles were okay, albeit not fresh. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen and was equally underwhelmed. We also got the Seaweed Salad, which was too sweet and drowning in dressing, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl, which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall, a really disappointing meal. Avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Silverlake Ramen was one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I moved to LB for college. I've dined in quite often to get my ramen fix with friends and I have only great experiences here! I always order the Blaze ramen because it's so good and gives the right amount of kick. The noodles here are light and chewy. The broth is super creamy and tastes amazing. One thing I found really interesting was the way you order before being seated. It doesn't seem to pose a problem for me so I just go with the flow. Be careful though because wait times here can get pretty insane. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a fulfilling, warm bowl of ramen in the LB area (:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>So much hype around Silverlake Ramen and now I don't have to drive too far!Parking wasn't terrible as the shopping area is large. Location is a decent size and had a very open vibe. You enter and order at the kiosk or with the cashier and they help you find a seat. Waiters were friendly but it did take some time to flag a couple down since it was busy. Not their fault though.Ramen was a solid 7/10!

       "\t<tr><td>The arguable king in Ramen on the eastside of Los Angeles arrives in Long Beach. Much like Pizza, Pho, and Sushi, many will judge you based on your favorites and although I am hesitant to commit to a single favorite - on Yelp anyway - nearly half of Los Angeles would swear by Silverlake Ramen which is unlikely due to its location on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, you shouldn't be able to find a real deal bowl of Ramen on Sunset of all places, right? Wrong. Well, Silverlake Ramen has done so well for itself it is expanding with a new spot in Long Beach and another on the way for Irvine in The Spectrum. The Long Beach location is in the center of The Hangar, a newly developed (and extremely trendy) area featuring a massive food hall and boutique-style stores near the Long Beach Airport or the \"LGB\" if you are a local. The interior is modern, sleek, and a little funky as far as a modern Ramen joint goes but the ordering procedure is... well... straight-up wack thanks to the single ordering kiosk being employed, the weird way they assign you to a table, and the line back up this creates. The only plus about this strange fast-casual format is that tips are unnecessary. As for the Ramen itself? I thought you'd never ask. I naturally ordered the celebrated Tonkatsu Ramen. The presentation of the Ramen is quite noble. The portions include an adequate amount of food to serve a single starving person or two reasonably hungry people (perhaps 3?). The pork broth takes 16 hours to render which makes it both intense and savory, with the rich essences erupting at the first spoonful. The Chashu is laid over the Noodles and a bed of Green Onions, which were cleverly glazed on the edges. The Chashu dissolved in the mouth and implemented the ideal amount of saltiness.The Bean Sprouts provided a crunchiness that juxtaposes itself flawlessly with the smoothness of the Noodles. It is merited to mention that a single bowl is remarkably filling, with multiple customers taking to-go bowls home on my visit. For a mere $13.00 after-tax, it is a deal that cannot be missed. I was highly impressed with Silverlake Ramen and cannot wait for a return stop. They clearly have found significant investment capital as this is not the only outpost they are opening - expect to see new locations soon in Huntington Beach, Irvine, Cerritos, Oxnard, and Koreatown. Ramen lovers rejoice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Expensive for ramen but quite substantial. The Classic Tonkotsu and the Blaze are both super rich. If the broths were any thicker, they'd be tsukemen broth. In fact, the two items are so similar that I suspect the only difference is the chili paste in the Blaze. I love that they use spinach in the ramen. It's not common to find actual green vegetable in ramen and the spinach was a great addition to the creamy broth. I also love the thick chasu pork. It's fatty and tender and super satisfying to bite into. Although there is technically only one slice of chashu, I couldn't actually finish it in one sitting and had to take it home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",

At least that's what my friend and I found when we stopped in for a very late lunch one weekday. I don't know how packed the lot gets during lunch hour or on the weekends however, we drove up, and right into a spot. Walked in, ordered and sat down. No wait. The experience started off well and only got better from there. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu and a Chicken Karaage. I know it's like a broken record when I say it wasn't spicy, but it wasn't. However, the broth wasn't bland or too oily and for my taste, didn't need much in the way of condiments for flavor. The noodles were done al dente, as I prefer. As for the chicken, I liked the juicy meat however, the skin was a little too done for me. Not sure if that makes sense however, it seemed like it was bathed in oil too long and for me the outer layer had an oily taste. The dipping sauce which comes with the order took care of that taste for me - otherwise I might have considered sending it back. The service was friendly and efficient. Attentive not so much as not much was needed. Someone took our order. Someone brought our utensils and water. Then someone brought our order to the table. Not much follow up was needed as the bill was already paid and we were close enough to the water dispenser for refills. I had a pleasant experience. The only feedback I have is that the music volume was a little too loud. Most of the visit, I had difficulty hearing my friend speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Yay a good RAMEN place in LB!Located directly behind Georgia's, Silverlake Ramen brings the ramen fire! You walk in and make a right to the register to order and pay. You can choose to tip at this time or leave a tip on your table before you leave. They give you a number and wait for your ramen to be served to you. There is outdoor seating as well as heaters. This was my first time eating here and the service was pretty good. The servers bring your drinks to your table. Onto the ramen, I got the shoyu with the pork belly. It was so good. The pork belly piece was so thick and tender. It was a good portion and I didn't even finish it. The noodles were standard and the broth was tasty. The broth could be a little hotter (temperature wise) in my opinion. But otherwise it was good. Parking isn't an issue and it shares the lot with other businesses. I'll probably come back and try the tonkotsu and e karaage!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Got my ramen delivered but I've been hearing so much about this place. I chose the blaze- a spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! The ramen broth was so tasty. For my protein I choose chicken. I've never had chicken in my ramen unless get it without protein. The texture didn't sit right with me so I took it out. After that, everything was superb.

       "\t<tr><td>Ambiance: the set-up is totally bad!!! They only have one register open.Very chilled with an average noise level inside as for the outside it's too cramped and one of the table is blocking the exit way. Food: Pork bun is a must, the pork belly is so soft and the Saunders with the bun went well together. Crispy chicken karaage was not crispy at all, it's not what a karaage is usually is (you'll see in the picture). The chicken itself is lightly breaded so it's more like on a healthy side so they should rename it to something else. The Shoyu was good, the chicken was tender and soft enough to chew on, the broth was delicious. The Blaze ramen was okay, the broth was a little too thick for me and the pork belly that came with it was very hard and hard to chew I would have expected to be soft like the pork bun but I was really disappointed. Service: They were lagging because they were having a receipt print out problem and it took them a while till we can finally order, wished they offered a free drink after eating for nearly 10min until our order was place. The waiter did follow up once we were seated but it took them forever for my pork bun or the katrsge and our ramen came first/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>I was more than excited hearing that a Silverlake Ramen was opening in Long Beach! I love going to and trying new Ramen places but Silverlake will always be one of my staple favorites to go to. I got the spicy tonkotsu, the blaze. First off, the broth was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from the spice. The noodles were well cooked, had a good texture and was accompanied by pork that was very tender. Every time I come here, it is always packed with people, but in my opinion, the food is worth the wait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Not too much a fan of ramen, but my brother is a ramen connoisseur and took me here since it was new and close to home. Gotta say, the ramen was fine (again, I'm not a huge fan). My mom, dad, aunt enjoyed it so no complaints. If you're looking for a hot bowl of soup, this place will do. ^_^By the way. They use the new type of touch ordering system and then make you wait before you sit down. I'm not a fan of the new trend in touch ordering , but oh well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>My friends &amp; I were so happy to hear about this spot opening up! It's located at LBX, near other restaurants. Parking isn't bad. We came on a Sunday afternoon &amp; surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected for a grand opening. When you walk in, you order first then find a seat. It's not bad, but going in with a fairly big group, it might be hard to find seats together. They do have outside seating though and their tables are pretty close to each other both in and outside. They also have bar seating a high table seating with seats on one side. Their service is great too!It took maybe like 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the classic tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the blaze one. My other friends ordered the same as us. I was honestly expecting a lot since I loved it when I went to the LA location. However, I was underwhelmed.. The broth wasn't as rich and flavorful. The meat was a little chewy and dry for me. They also forgot to add meat to one of the orders. We were a bit surprised by that lol. The noodles were good and chewy though! The egg was fine, but wish it was more of a soft boiled egg. Maybe it wasn't as great since it was still their opening weekend. But definitely will give it another visit in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>I decided to try this place for the first time with a friend for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We didn't have to wait since it wasn't busy. One thing that I noticed right off was the self order kiosk. It was super convenient to just walk in and order what you wanted without having any pressure. The menu on the kiosk provided pictures of the food and it made the ordering process fast and easy. I decided to order the vegetarian ramen and I was a little hesitant at first but it didn't disappoint me. The broth was super flavorful and it had a good amount of vegetables and noddles. They also provide soy sauce and gyro sauce along with a chili paste to add more flavor. I was satisfied with the overall taste, presentation portion, and service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or is trying ramen for the first time. You won't regret it because your tummy will be happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>I landed in Los Angeles and not even an hour later, I'm already hitting up a restaurant cos' I am just a hangry girl! This was the place I came across first because it was the closest ramen shop to the car rental place I was at. What do I order at a ramen shop? Not ramen of course. I got three dishes: a side of bamboo shoots, a cucumber salad with imitation crab meat and a Shiitake Enoki mushroom salad (Don't recall the proper name of the salad but I can't seem to find it on their website.) The salads were just meh but I don't blame them because this is a ramen place after all. I really like how they have a self serve kiosk where you can make your own order and then you sit down and they will bring you your food. I see this is very common in LA and very uncommon in NYC.The staff was friendly and the place is nice and bright and very welcoming. I like this place. I should try their ramen sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

The pork was not my favorite but the flavor made up for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>There's a big flaw with their ordering system. We were directed to use the electronic ordering system at the kiosk but while we were using it, other customers were allowed to cut in ahead of us and order at the cashier. Due to this, we had to take a seat at the bar since all the tables were taken after having other customers cut in front. Im not sure if the hostess was trained to do that or what but it doesnt leave a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>What can I say. This ramen place exceeded my expectations. The food was great and the service was hospitable, almost like I could befriend all the waiters. One waiter in particular was very nice and accommodating, I believe his name was Andy. If you decide to come to this ramen place, keep on the look out for this guy. He'll take care of you.

       "\t<tr><td>Came here for our first time and enjoyed the experience but wouldn't call it extraordinary. The ordering kiosks were not working but the hostess was friendly and helped us order. Once seated after ordering the girl who brings the drinks was fast and very nice. We ordered the steamed pork bun and chicken karaage Â as apps. The chicken karaage was supposed to have ginger and some other toppings on top according to the pic and description in the menu but they came plain with sauce on the side. I wasn't a fan of those but my friend liked them. The steamed pork bun however, was AMAZING! My favorite thing by far, the flavor was different and just soooo good. The spicy ramen was good but the broth could have used a little something something. Â My friend and I both ordered med spicy but Her ramen was def mild and came out at least 5 mins after mine when we ordered at the same time :/ some kinks to work out still but overall an okay place to eat dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

Â When I arrived home the food was still hot and not soggy and I enjoyed the flavor of the soup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>I was super excited to hear that silver lake ramen is now in Long Beach. I've been here twice. The first time was in September 2019, party of three on a weekday night. Ordering was simple, the cashier took our order and we were given and number to take to our table (there were plenty to choose from). Food came in a reasonable time, it was delicious (although I would say the original location is better). Now my most recent visit was completely different. Came in on a Friday night, party of three. The line to order was almost out the door and not really moving. Â Apparently they had allowed to many people to order food without having a table for them? We order, then wait about 10 min to be seated. Once dated outside, we were confused as to how the servers knew what we ordered since we didn't get an number for our table. A serve came to our table and asked did we order any drinks, we told them our drink order but were confused by how our food was going to get to us if they didn't know our drink order yet alone our food order. Maybe 10 min later one of our ramens came out. Then nothing for 15 min. Eventually the other 2 ramens came out buy my friend was already almonds done with hers! I had also ordered a side of gyoza which did not come until about 20 min after we were all done eating lol. I asked for a refund on the gyoza and they were very apologetic aBout it.

       "\t<tr><td>I am providing this review since there are correctable issues. Â We enjoy ramen immensely and it is in our interest to have Â good ramen restaurants in our area. Â So I decided to take the time to offer this review.It was our first time at Silverlake and my son ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered Shoyu Ramen. Â My Shoyu ramen was barely warm. Â The egg yolk was cold as was pork belly steak. Â I went today because I had a craving but it was not at all satisfying. Â No part of a bowl of ramen, whether it is the soup, vegetable, eggs, meat or even the bowl, should be served cold. Â This is just amateurish. Â The noodle was a bit stiff for my taste but I'll chalk it up as their style. Â Aside from the temperature, I really didn't enjoy the 1/2\" thick grilled pork belly steak. Â Shoyu ramen is a rather delicate Â dish and the half-warmed stiff pork belly sitting in a lukewarm soup just did not do it for me. Â I'd much prefer thin slices of chashu.My son did enjoy his tonkotsu ramen, though it was too spicy to savor the subtleties, if there were any. Â On a separate note, there were no seating that I would have found to be a good table. Â Each was either by the door, major aisle, or the restroom.

       "\t<tr><td>My husband and I were looking forward to this after hearing good things, and since I had a sudden craving for gyoza, figured why not. TL:DR version -Recommendations for improvement: seating system, carry all menu items, keep utensils and napkin containers full, faster service.Positives: I am a positive person and I can't think of anything! MAJOR SAD FACE.Full version:Walked in and wasn't really sure where to go, we saw the line to the right and followed the line. Ordered at the kiosk, that was pretty cool, except they were sold out of gyoza. Ugh. We scanned through the menu, and there were actually a lot of items sold out, including their green tea (that's all I remember), but that was a bummer. We ordered chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, shoyu on fire. You pay everything up front at the kiosk or with the cashier, including tip. We're all paid up and tipped and sitting by 4:57pm.We sit at the table right behind the cashier, wait, five mins later or so, our chicken karaage arrives... there aren't any napkins in the utensil container on my table, so I get up and get it myself from the communal table... no big deal, we're happy... for now.They have a seating system where they match the ticket number to a table number in their system. There's no table number that you get, no buzzer, food just shows up. The problem with that is that the customer doesn't exactly know that, so it seems like we can move tables if there's a better option. I heard at least four conversations between the cashier and the server not finding the tables, and even a disagreement between the cashier and a server, with the cashier stating to a server \"well if they move what do you want me to do about it?\", in a very non-teamwork kind of tone. Not something I want to hear as a customer, especially since I'm sitting less than a foot away from the cashier (move that table or add a partition please), so I told the server \"hey, those customers moved to that table over there\". But yeah... at least four parties that came in after us moved, and I knew exactly where they moved to because I was waiting for FORTY+ minutes for my food. Not a single server came until I was finally able to flag them down after about TWENTY FIVE mins after the karaage came. And all those people that came in after us that moved, they all got their food before we got ours.If I didn't have to pay up front, and tip these people, I would've just walked out of there. But with the already super long wait, and not wanting to deal with getting a refund and having that be super slow and getting more irritated, we waited. Food arrives at 5:38 FINAL-FREAKIN-LY, and again, I had to get up cuz this time there weren't any soup spoons. Like seriously, I got here before the dinner rush, doesn't anyone check inventory? F***. The food portion was big. Lots of meat, which was nice to see. The pork belly in mine was thick... that's usually not a problem, but if you're going to have thick cuts, at least cook it until it's tender. Mine was tough, and I would've rather had thinner slices. Sure, portion was huge - for $12.50/bowl, it should be. What a mediocre experience. Silverlake Ramen should've just stayed in Silverlake.</td></tr>\n",

Have beef twice and will be going back soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Had very high expectations when trying this place out. We have tried many ramen spots in the past and were hoping to add this to our list of favorites. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Their line was out the door, you had to wait and order at the register before sitting down at a table. Kind of an odd way of doing things, but maybe it was supposed to make the dining experience easier? I am not entirely sure, so we ordered the tonkotsu ramen and a couple of beers. I kindly asked the cashier if we were able to order more beers after we sat at the table. He politely said no, and stated we would have to wait in the line to order another drink. That was unfortunate, but we still had a positive attitude and couldn't wait to try the ramen. While eating the ramen, the chashu pork was cut into huge slices and was extremely chewy. It grossed us out so much, that we pushed the meat to the side and finished the noodles and broth, which were delicious! May give this place another try in the future, but not likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Pretty disappointed, I was really looking forward to the iconic thick cuts of tender pork that the original Silverlake ramen consistently provided. Just had their bowl of The Blaze, and the the two cuts of pork were very overcooked, hard to chew, and just takes away the overall enjoyment of the meal. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, but still compared to the other silverlake, I've eaten there a few times and never had overcooked meat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Service was great. But the ramen was not it. I tried this place on opening day because I heard the other locations in LA are popular. I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was underwhelming. Service was good and the location itself is nice but yeah, their ramen is bland. No flavor, not even chilli paste could save it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Tried the original. Broth is cream based and had no flavor. Only got two pieces of pork and barely any veggies. The overall dish was flavorless.

I will try this place in another month and see if they have their act together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Horrible. Waited almost an hour for a couple bowls of ramen. And the service was horrible. The servers were incompetent and didn't have answers for why the food was taking so long. All of the food was coming out at different times. And people who ordered after, got their food first. It definitely was not worth an hour wait. I'll never go there again. They should have stayed in Silverlake. They make you pay before you eat, and It makes sense because then people would leave for having to wait so long. Never again.

       "\t I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!

       "\t Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\\\\\n",
       "\t Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "\t *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",
       "\t Probably one of the best broths for ramen that I've had thus far. There's a hint of roasted garlic in the tonkotsu broth that just completes it.You order and pay from kiosks in the front, then show your receipt to the host in the front who will seat you. There's a variety of seating options: the traditional table, high table, bar or patio seating. This makes it welcoming for parties of all sizes. We sat at the bar so we weren't hoarding a table from bigger parties. Maybe about a 15-minute wait for food at most, but that was because there were lots of take-out orders before us.We ordered a small karaage with spicy aioli sauce, the classic tonkotsu ramen and the blaze ramen. Like I said before--the broth was amazing! Noodles were firm and on the thinner side, and the chashu was a tender slab of pork belly that was to die for. For the blaze ramen, you had a choice of 3 levels of spiciness. At level 2, my boyfriend said it was still flavorful with a kick of heat. We highly recommend this place. Apparently there's another Silverlake Ramen in Silver Lake (yes, that was a \"no, duh\" moment for me). We just happened to stumble upon this location. There's plenty of parking in this mall and no wait when we came. Apparently the wait is ridiculous at the Silver Lake location, so just plan ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

       "\t Decided to try a new ramen place. When first walking in, we were directed to the right to place our order. There is two options in ordering. You can either order on the touch screen or with the host. We opted to do the touch screen to see the set up. It was very easy to use however if you want to order quick and be sat quick then order with the host. About 3 parties after us ordered through the host and was sat before our order was submitted. We ordered a California roll and 2 Blaze Ramens with pork. The California roll was dry but the Blaze Ramen was good. We were pleasantly surprised that the pieces of pork were very thick and juicy. It was a bit salty but it went well with the broth. The noodles were on the thin side and were hotter bottom of the bowl.Flavor wise: The broth itself was creamy with a subtle flavor to it. For those who like spice, the spicy paste added a nice heat that wasn't overbearing. You can also control the amount of spice by choosing your option of mild, medium or hot. If you would like it spicier there is a jar of spicy paste on every table.Temperature wise: The broth was warm but could've been hotter and the egg was cold in the center. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very clean, modern and there was good music playlist. The restaurant is small but it seemed more spacious due to the ceiling being elevated and the amount of windows. It has limited seating inside but they have a patio area to make up for it. The staff was not too attentive other than bringing our food, probably because it was slow. On the bright side, most of what we needed was on the table. They had good spoons and good quality chopsticks, which if always appreciated when eating a bowl of ramen. We ended up sitting in-between both of the doors since it was the only seating available inside which kind of sucked because we got air coming in from both ways. Price: The bowls were on the pricier side. We paid about \\$40 for 2 bowls and 1 California Roll. Every side extra cost about an extra \\$0.50-\\$1.50It wasn't a bad experience nor a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",
       "\t This place is located in that new shopping/eating center in Long Beach, right by the airport. My wife brought me here because we both love ramen. We were looking for a new ramen place too, since the one we used to frequent has dropped down in quality quite a bit. Not to mention, Silverlake Ramen has Tonkatsu brother that is deeper, richer, and tastier than any Tonkatsu Broth I've had so far here in the United States. By that, I mean to imply that I've also had Tokatsu ramen, at various other places, when I used to live in Michigan. The noodles are nice and thick, but not too thick. The egg is PERFECTLY cooked with the consistency being somewhere between soft boiled and medium boiled. I believe it has some kind of seasoning on it too, which is a nice touch. When I saw pictures of their Tokatsu on their Yelp listing, I got really excited because the broth looked really thick and milky/cloudy. That's usually a really good sign that the Tokatsu broth is REALLY tasty. Oh, and the pork is really lean, and less fatty than a lot of other ramen places I've tried.Anyway, 10/10, would have again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",
       "\t Came on a Thursday night, 6pm ish in Jan. No wait...Minus:1. the weird way to order (millennial-ish kiosk) 2. weird way to get seated (no one really tells you how the order, seating is supposed to work).3. Lack of \"service\"-no one really greets you after you sit, they just look at your receipt, drop your ramen bowl off.. then you are left alone unless you flag someone down for whatever your need.Parking: easy tons a lbx. Park by the tj max side.. easy/out.I really liked my ramen and gyoza! Edamame pass... micowave tasting beans and minimal salt..meh (you should do spicy garlic edamame!!I got:-the shoyu on fire level 2 spice with pork bellyThis was sooo delish! Clean broth, lots of umami. Â The roasted jalapeno, fresh geen onion, slab o meat, corn kernels all worked well.-great ratio noodles to broth (you can order more noodles on the side if you like stuffing your face with more carbs).-noodles were perfect. Â Bit of chewy.. not soggy.-the fire level was perfect. Â Keeps the hot in you mouth without worrying about gonna come out the other end the next day.We sat at the small kitchen counter watching the ramen cooking craze.Its a small space. Â Maybe sits 50ish people max, less tables more community seating.They seem to do a TON of take outs which is maybe why the in Â house service folks are distracted.We'd come back. Â Hope they work on their customer service a bit... would have given 5 stars of so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",
       "\t Based on the name of this place, I had a feeling Silverlake Ramen would have vegan options. Luckily their menu clearly states what is vegetarian and they also provide an allergen menu online so I can further research what is plant-based.The Veggie Ramen has tasty miso-based broth! I like that the presentation is very green due to the broccolini, baby greens, kale, and avocado. This is the first time I've had avocado in ramen. Not sure how I feel about that but I also won't kick it out of bed. There's also tofu, corn, and bean sprouts. Though you can't see it in my photo, there are mushrooms hidden under all those toppings. This dish is very noodle heavy which might hit the spot for some people. But I might ask if I can get half the amount of noodles next time. The day we came here, it was a particularly cold December evening so this soup totally hit the spot! bit.ly/2QxjVI3The Mabo Tofu Bowl was quite yummy as well. It is a bit different from other mapo tofu dishes I've had. Usually, I have the sauce mixed in with the tofu. This version has the sauce on top of the tofu. I loved the eggplant! The ginger was a nice addition and I love that it was topped with fresh green onions. I hoped that they had brown rice as an option but unfortunately they don't have it. But I'm hoping they might consider offering it in the future. bit.ly/2QOHmeMThe two times we've been here, they had a cashier taking orders. It makes me wonder why they have the self-service touch screens? I prefer customer service from a real person anyway. And they're friendly and helpful here too. Also, purse hooks at the bar-height tables!Plenty of free parking at LBX including charging stations for our Tesla :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\\n",
       "\t Wow! What a delicious and efficient ramen spot! I stopped by to have lunch here and it was everything I could have wanted. You order upon entry so it's quick-- no need to wait for a server or anything and your food comes out within minutes.I order the Classic ramen with pork belly and I could not get enough. The soup was the perfect amount of creamy and the egg was smooth and cooked just right. (My mouth is seriously watering as I write this). The portions are also super generousThe servers are patient and attentive and while parking can be tough, it is very worth the stop.

       "\t I came here on a Monday lunch and we didn't have to wait. You order at the kiosk or the cashier and proceed to find your own seat. We got the classic and the blaze ramen, the latter apparently being their best seller. You can pick the meat (we picked pork on both). We also ordered a pork bun on the side.The food comes out fairly quick. The broth is very creamy and thick - really rich ramen. The bowls have decent servings of noodles and soup and a thick cut of pork.I think that the classic and blaze have the same base but the blaze with the spice takes it to another level, so I would recommend this. The bun was ok - pork was excellent but I wasn't feeling the mayo.Overall not bad - I would like to try their gyoza or rice bowls next time just to try.Perhaps between 2 people one ramen and the others on the side would be enough, as I wasn't able to finish my ramen.Then again, it was lunch and i don't normally eat a lot for lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",
       "\t Supah creamyyyy ramen and pork CHOP belly like at an American steakhouse. They're huge! Friend got the tsukemen, got 3 meats, which was Overkill, but he gave me 1 of them for The Blaze that I got which only had 1, and that's not cool.Geeeeet the black garlic oil with the classic blaze! Try half without, then finish the second half with the oil, A WHOLE DIFF SOUP.The crispy rice appetizer is like eating Hashbrowns! Supah solid. Fun to take a few bites into it. Mushrooms with the salad are solid. Decent portion, nice vinagrette. Feels like modern take on a ramen restaurant, down to the food choices, vibe, and logistics of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",
       "\t I ate at the original Silverlake Ramen in Silverlake a few years ago, and loved their Veggie Ramen. I recall it being rich, flavorful, and creamy. The company has since rapidly expanded, and when this new location popped up in Long Beach, I was excited to try them again. We ordered delivery via Postmates, since we are out of their delivery range-they are located near the airport. This time, the Veggie Ramen was barely edible. The grayish broth was completely flavorless, and the weird assortment of veggies (broccolini, corn, huge chunks of undercooked soft tofu, avocado (?!)) had a bitter aftertaste. I love avocado as much as the next Californian, but it has no place in ramen. The noodles were okay, albeit not fresh. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen and was equally underwhelmed. We also got the Seaweed Salad, which was too sweet and drowning in dressing, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl, which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall, a really disappointing meal. Avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",
       "\t One taste of the spicy, creamy tonkotsu broth and I knew... my experience was going to be extraordinary.At Silverlake, the ramen is prepared fresh and articulate. Generous toppings are given, great portion sizes are delivered, and flavors tend to soak me into moments where my tastebuds seemed to have a fun time exploring this new and creative flavor. The broth is Oh, So Creamy!-- the creamiest ever... and that was why Silverlake's experience was so unique.Truly great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",
       "\t Silverlake Ramen was one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I moved to LB for college. I've dined in quite often to get my ramen fix with friends and I have only great experiences here! I always order the Blaze ramen because it's so good and gives the right amount of kick. The noodles here are light and chewy. The broth is super creamy and tastes amazing. One thing I found really interesting was the way you order before being seated. It doesn't seem to pose a problem for me so I just go with the flow. Be careful though because wait times here can get pretty insane. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a fulfilling, warm bowl of ramen in the LB area (:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",
       "\t So much hype around Silverlake Ramen and now I don't have to drive too far!Parking wasn't terrible as the shopping area is large. Location is a decent size and had a very open vibe. You enter and order at the kiosk or with the cashier and they help you find a seat. Waiters were friendly but it did take some time to flag a couple down since it was busy. Not their fault though.Ramen was a solid 7/10! The broth was great and tasty, just wish I had a tad more noodles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",
       "\t The arguable king in Ramen on the eastside of Los Angeles arrives in Long Beach. Much like Pizza, Pho, and Sushi, many will judge you based on your favorites and although I am hesitant to commit to a single favorite - on Yelp anyway - nearly half of Los Angeles would swear by Silverlake Ramen which is unlikely due to its location on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, you shouldn't be able to find a real deal bowl of Ramen on Sunset of all places, right? Wrong. Well, Silverlake Ramen has done so well for itself it is expanding with a new spot in Long Beach and another on the way for Irvine in The Spectrum. The Long Beach location is in the center of The Hangar, a newly developed (and extremely trendy) area featuring a massive food hall and boutique-style stores near the Long Beach Airport or the \"LGB\" if you are a local. The interior is modern, sleek, and a little funky as far as a modern Ramen joint goes but the ordering procedure is... well... straight-up wack thanks to the single ordering kiosk being employed, the weird way they assign you to a table, and the line back up this creates. The only plus about this strange fast-casual format is that tips are unnecessary. As for the Ramen itself? I thought you'd never ask. I naturally ordered the celebrated Tonkatsu Ramen. The presentation of the Ramen is quite noble. The portions include an adequate amount of food to serve a single starving person or two reasonably hungry people (perhaps 3?). The pork broth takes 16 hours to render which makes it both intense and savory, with the rich essences erupting at the first spoonful. The Chashu is laid over the Noodles and a bed of Green Onions, which were cleverly glazed on the edges. The Chashu dissolved in the mouth and implemented the ideal amount of saltiness.The Bean Sprouts provided a crunchiness that juxtaposes itself flawlessly with the smoothness of the Noodles. It is merited to mention that a single bowl is remarkably filling, with multiple customers taking to-go bowls home on my visit. For a mere \\$13.00 after-tax, it is a deal that cannot be missed. I was highly impressed with Silverlake Ramen and cannot wait for a return stop. They clearly have found significant investment capital as this is not the only outpost they are opening - expect to see new locations soon in Huntington Beach, Irvine, Cerritos, Oxnard, and Koreatown. Ramen lovers rejoice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",
       "\t Expensive for ramen but quite substantial. The Classic Tonkotsu and the Blaze are both super rich. If the broths were any thicker, they'd be tsukemen broth. In fact, the two items are so similar that I suspect the only difference is the chili paste in the Blaze. I love that they use spinach in the ramen. It's not common to find actual green vegetable in ramen and the spinach was a great addition to the creamy broth. I also love the thick chasu pork. It's fatty and tender and super satisfying to bite into. Although there is technically only one slice of chashu, I couldn't actually finish it in one sitting and had to take it home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",
       "\t When you think of Ramen, the Long Beach area usually doesn't come to mind. Well, a few spots have opened up and Silverlake is one of them. If you hadn't heard of the Long Beach Exchange - it's a new addition to the food scene in the Long Beach area. Silverlake Ramen isn't located in the Hangar, but as one of the shops next to Georgia's, facing Ulta and Old Navy. Lots of parking. At least that's what my friend and I found when we stopped in for a very late lunch one weekday. I don't know how packed the lot gets during lunch hour or on the weekends however, we drove up, and right into a spot. Walked in, ordered and sat down. No wait. The experience started off well and only got better from there. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu and a Chicken Karaage. I know it's like a broken record when I say it wasn't spicy, but it wasn't. However, the broth wasn't bland or too oily and for my taste, didn't need much in the way of condiments for flavor. The noodles were done al dente, as I prefer. As for the chicken, I liked the juicy meat however, the skin was a little too done for me. Not sure if that makes sense however, it seemed like it was bathed in oil too long and for me the outer layer had an oily taste. The dipping sauce which comes with the order took care of that taste for me - otherwise I might have considered sending it back. The service was friendly and efficient. Attentive not so much as not much was needed. Someone took our order. Someone brought our utensils and water. Then someone brought our order to the table. Not much follow up was needed as the bill was already paid and we were close enough to the water dispenser for refills. I had a pleasant experience. The only feedback I have is that the music volume was a little too loud. Most of the visit, I had difficulty hearing my friend speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",
       "\t Yay a good RAMEN place in LB!Located directly behind Georgia's, Silverlake Ramen brings the ramen fire! You walk in and make a right to the register to order and pay. You can choose to tip at this time or leave a tip on your table before you leave. They give you a number and wait for your ramen to be served to you. There is outdoor seating as well as heaters. This was my first time eating here and the service was pretty good. The servers bring your drinks to your table. Onto the ramen, I got the shoyu with the pork belly. It was so good. The pork belly piece was so thick and tender. It was a good portion and I didn't even finish it. The noodles were standard and the broth was tasty. The broth could be a little hotter (temperature wise) in my opinion. But otherwise it was good. Parking isn't an issue and it shares the lot with other businesses.

       "\t Got my ramen delivered but I've been hearing so much about this place. I chose the blaze- a spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! The ramen broth was so tasty. For my protein I choose chicken. I've never had chicken in my ramen unless get it without protein. The texture didn't sit right with me so I took it out. After that, everything was superb. I appreciate the presentation and the prices were average for a joint at the hanger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",
       "\t Ambiance: the set-up is totally bad!!! They only have one register open.Very chilled with an average noise level inside as for the outside it's too cramped and one of the table is blocking the exit way. Food: Pork bun is a must, the pork belly is so soft and the Saunders with the bun went well together. Crispy chicken karaage was not crispy at all, it's not what a karaage is usually is (you'll see in the picture). The chicken itself is lightly breaded so it's more like on a healthy side so they should rename it to something else. The Shoyu was good, the chicken was tender and soft enough to chew on, the broth was delicious. The Blaze ramen was okay, the broth was a little too thick for me and the pork belly that came with it was very hard and hard to chew I would have expected to be soft like the pork bun but I was really disappointed. Service: They were lagging because they were having a receipt print out problem and it took them a while till we can finally order, wished they offered a free drink after eating for nearly 10min until our order was place. The waiter did follow up once we were seated but it took them forever for my pork bun or the katrsge and our ramen came first/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",
       "\t I was more than excited hearing that a Silverlake Ramen was opening in Long Beach! I love going to and trying new Ramen places but Silverlake will always be one of my staple favorites to go to. I got the spicy tonkotsu, the blaze. First off, the broth was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from the spice. The noodles were well cooked, had a good texture and was accompanied by pork that was very tender. Every time I come here, it is always packed with people, but in my opinion, the food is worth the wait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

I'm not a fan of the new trend in touch ordering , but oh well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",
       "\t My friends \\& I were so happy to hear about this spot opening up! It's located at LBX, near other restaurants. Parking isn't bad. We came on a Sunday afternoon \\& surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected for a grand opening. When you walk in, you order first then find a seat. It's not bad, but going in with a fairly big group, it might be hard to find seats together. They do have outside seating though and their tables are pretty close to each other both in and outside. They also have bar seating a high table seating with seats on one side. Their service is great too!It took maybe like 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the classic tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the blaze one. My other friends ordered the same as us. I was honestly expecting a lot since I loved it when I went to the LA location. However, I was underwhelmed.. The broth wasn't as rich and flavorful. The meat was a little chewy and dry for me. They also forgot to add meat to one of the orders. We were a bit surprised by that lol. The noodles were good and chewy though! The egg was fine, but wish it was more of a soft boiled egg. Maybe it wasn't as great since it was still their opening weekend. But definitely will give it another visit in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",
       "\t I decided to try this place for the first time with a friend for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We didn't have to wait since it wasn't busy. One thing that I noticed right off was the self order kiosk. It was super convenient to just walk in and order what you wanted without having any pressure. The menu on the kiosk provided pictures of the food and it made the ordering process fast and easy. I decided to order the vegetarian ramen and I was a little hesitant at first but it didn't disappoint me. The broth was super flavorful and it had a good amount of vegetables and noddles. They also provide soy sauce and gyro sauce along with a chili paste to add more flavor. I was satisfied with the overall taste, presentation portion, and service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or is trying ramen for the first time. You won't regret it because your tummy will be happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",
       "\t I landed in Los Angeles and not even an hour later, I'm already hitting up a restaurant cos' I am just a hangry girl! This was the place I came across first because it was the closest ramen shop to the car rental place I was at. What do I order at a ramen shop? Not ramen of course. I got three dishes: a side of bamboo shoots, a cucumber salad with imitation crab meat and a Shiitake Enoki mushroom salad (Don't recall the proper name of the salad but I can't seem to find it on their website.) The salads were just meh but I don't blame them because this is a ramen place after all. I really like how they have a self serve kiosk where you can make your own order and then you sit down and they will bring you your food. I see this is very common in LA and very uncommon in NYC.The staff was friendly and the place is nice and bright and very welcoming. I like this place. I should try their ramen sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

       "\t We were 2nd in the line but the cashier still pushed us to use the machine to order. The machine took longer time and didn't have the toppings we wanted, so we turned back to the line, at that time she has already started the order for the people behind us and the seats we wanted has been taken. Not sure why she did that to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

       "\t There's a big flaw with their ordering system. We were directed to use the electronic ordering system at the kiosk but while we were using it, other customers were allowed to cut in ahead of us and order at the cashier. Due to this, we had to take a seat at the bar since all the tables were taken after having other customers cut in front. Im not sure if the hostess was trained to do that or what but it doesnt leave a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

       "\t What can I say. This ramen place exceeded my expectations. The food was great and the service was hospitable, almost like I could befriend all the waiters. One waiter in particular was very nice and accommodating, I believe his name was Andy. If you decide to come to this ramen place, keep on the look out for this guy. He'll take care of you. Overall a great experience would definitely come back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",
       "\t Came here for our first time and enjoyed the experience but wouldn't call it extraordinary. The ordering kiosks were not working but the hostess was friendly and helped us order. Once seated after ordering the girl who brings the drinks was fast and very nice. We ordered the steamed pork bun and chicken karaage Â as apps. The chicken karaage was supposed to have ginger and some other toppings on top according to the pic and description in the menu but they came plain with sauce on the side. I wasn't a fan of those but my friend liked them. The steamed pork bun however, was AMAZING! My favorite thing by far, the flavor was different and just soooo good. The spicy ramen was good but the broth could have used a little something something. Â My friend and I both ordered med spicy but Her ramen was def mild and came out at least 5 mins after mine when we ordered at the same time :/ some kinks to work out still but overall an okay place to eat dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",
       "\t We ordered Tonkotsu Ramen . The broth was too fatty \\& salty for us. And Â the pork was not taste ,like a ramen hub Â one . Â The service is so rude . I guess this restaurant is owned by Korean , so they likes copy of Â other Japanese restaurant . Â That's good idea . They don't know how to make real ramen ..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Can't wait to try their other food!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",
       "\t I ordered to go. I felt the price was a little pricey for fancy ramen but they provided a descent amount of food in my order. Â When I arrived home the food was still hot and not soggy and I enjoyed the flavor of the soup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",
       "\t I was super excited to hear that silver lake ramen is now in Long Beach. I've been here twice. The first time was in September 2019, party of three on a weekday night. Ordering was simple, the cashier took our order and we were given and number to take to our table (there were plenty to choose from). Food came in a reasonable time, it was delicious (although I would say the original location is better). Now my most recent visit was completely different. Came in on a Friday night, party of three. The line to order was almost out the door and not really moving. Â Apparently they had allowed to many people to order food without having a table for them? We order, then wait about 10 min to be seated. Once dated outside, we were confused as to how the servers knew what we ordered since we didn't get an number for our table. A serve came to our table and asked did we order any drinks, we told them our drink order but were confused by how our food was going to get to us if they didn't know our drink order yet alone our food order. Maybe 10 min later one of our ramens came out. Then nothing for 15 min. Eventually the other 2 ramens came out buy my friend was already almonds done with hers! I had also ordered a side of gyoza which did not come until about 20 min after we were all done eating lol. I asked for a refund on the gyoza and they were very apologetic aBout it.

       "\t I am providing this review since there are correctable issues. Â We enjoy ramen immensely and it is in our interest to have Â good ramen restaurants in our area. Â So I decided to take the time to offer this review.It was our first time at Silverlake and my son ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered Shoyu Ramen. Â My Shoyu ramen was barely warm. Â The egg yolk was cold as was pork belly steak. Â I went today because I had a craving but it was not at all satisfying. Â No part of a bowl of ramen, whether it is the soup, vegetable, eggs, meat or even the bowl, should be served cold. Â This is just amateurish. Â The noodle was a bit stiff for my taste but I'll chalk it up as their style. Â Aside from the temperature, I really didn't enjoy the 1/2\" thick grilled pork belly steak. Â Shoyu ramen is a rather delicate Â dish and the half-warmed stiff pork belly sitting in a lukewarm soup just did not do it for me. Â I'd much prefer thin slices of chashu.My son did enjoy his tonkotsu ramen, though it was too spicy to savor the subtleties, if there were any. Â On a separate note, there were no seating that I would have found to be a good table. Â Each was either by the door, major aisle, or the restroom.

       "\t My husband and I were looking forward to this after hearing good things, and since I had a sudden craving for gyoza, figured why not. TL:DR version -Recommendations for improvement: seating system, carry all menu items, keep utensils and napkin containers full, faster service.Positives: I am a positive person and I can't think of anything! MAJOR SAD FACE.Full version:Walked in and wasn't really sure where to go, we saw the line to the right and followed the line. Ordered at the kiosk, that was pretty cool, except they were sold out of gyoza. Ugh. We scanned through the menu, and there were actually a lot of items sold out, including their green tea (that's all I remember), but that was a bummer. We ordered chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, shoyu on fire. You pay everything up front at the kiosk or with the cashier, including tip. We're all paid up and tipped and sitting by 4:57pm.We sit at the table right behind the cashier, wait, five mins later or so, our chicken karaage arrives... there aren't any napkins in the utensil container on my table, so I get up and get it myself from the communal table... no big deal, we're happy... for now.They have a seating system where they match the ticket number to a table number in their system. There's no table number that you get, no buzzer, food just shows up. The problem with that is that the customer doesn't exactly know that, so it seems like we can move tables if there's a better option. I heard at least four conversations between the cashier and the server not finding the tables, and even a disagreement between the cashier and a server, with the cashier stating to a server \"well if they move what do you want me to do about it?\", in a very non-teamwork kind of tone. Not something I want to hear as a customer, especially since I'm sitting less than a foot away from the cashier (move that table or add a partition please), so I told the server \"hey, those customers moved to that table over there\". But yeah... at least four parties that came in after us moved, and I knew exactly where they moved to because I was waiting for FORTY+ minutes for my food. Not a single server came until I was finally able to flag them down after about TWENTY FIVE mins after the karaage came. And all those people that came in after us that moved, they all got their food before we got ours.If I didn't have to pay up front, and tip these people, I would've just walked out of there. But with the already super long wait, and not wanting to deal with getting a refund and having that be super slow and getting more irritated, we waited. Food arrives at 5:38 FINAL-FREAKIN-LY, and again, I had to get up cuz this time there weren't any soup spoons. Like seriously, I got here before the dinner rush, doesn't anyone check inventory? F***. The food portion was big. Lots of meat, which was nice to see. The pork belly in mine was thick... that's usually not a problem, but if you're going to have thick cuts, at least cook it until it's tender. Mine was tough, and I would've rather had thinner slices. Sure, portion was huge - for \\$12.50/bowl, it should be. What a mediocre experience. Silverlake Ramen should've just stayed in Silverlake.\\\\\n",
       "\t In Raman heavy Long Beach this is still a great addition. Â The chicken Soup style ramen is unlike any I've had before, broth is rich and delicious and the noodles perfectly firm.

Have beef twice and will be going back soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",
       "\t Had very high expectations when trying this place out. We have tried many ramen spots in the past and were hoping to add this to our list of favorites. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Their line was out the door, you had to wait and order at the register before sitting down at a table. Kind of an odd way of doing things, but maybe it was supposed to make the dining experience easier? I am not entirely sure, so we ordered the tonkotsu ramen and a couple of beers. I kindly asked the cashier if we were able to order more beers after we sat at the table. He politely said no, and stated we would have to wait in the line to order another drink. That was unfortunate, but we still had a positive attitude and couldn't wait to try the ramen. While eating the ramen, the chashu pork was cut into huge slices and was extremely chewy. It grossed us out so much, that we pushed the meat to the side and finished the noodles and broth, which were delicious! May give this place another try in the future, but not likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",
       "\t Pretty disappointed, I was really looking forward to the iconic thick cuts of tender pork that the original Silverlake ramen consistently provided. Just had their bowl of The Blaze, and the the two cuts of pork were very overcooked, hard to chew, and just takes away the overall enjoyment of the meal. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, but still compared to the other silverlake, I've eaten there a few times and never had overcooked meat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

       "\t Service was great. But the ramen was not it. I tried this place on opening day because I heard the other locations in LA are popular. I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was underwhelming. Service was good and the location itself is nice but yeah, their ramen is bland. No flavor, not even chilli paste could save it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",
       "\t Tried the original. Broth is cream based and had no flavor. Only got two pieces of pork and barely any veggies. The overall dish was flavorless.

       "\t Came in on a Saturday. Food just average. Service is poor. I ordered and was seated at 9:03PM. First item arrived at 9:32 and the second one at 9:36. Restaurant was about 60\\% full. The other 3 Ramen restaurants within a 5 minute drive from this location don't make me wait 1/2hr for ramen. I will try this place in another month and see if they have their act together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",
       "\t Horrible. Waited almost an hour for a couple bowls of ramen. And the service was horrible. The servers were incompetent and didn't have answers for why the food was taking so long. All of the food was coming out at different times. And people who ordered after, got their food first. It definitely was not worth an hour wait. I'll never go there again. They should have stayed in Silverlake. They make you pay before you eat, and It makes sense because then people would leave for having to wait so long. Never again.

Definitely going back again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",

       "| I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!

       "| Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow. |\n",
       "| Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| Probably one of the best broths for ramen that I've had thus far. There's a hint of roasted garlic in the tonkotsu broth that just completes it.You order and pay from kiosks in the front, then show your receipt to the host in the front who will seat you. There's a variety of seating options: the traditional table, high table, bar or patio seating. This makes it welcoming for parties of all sizes. We sat at the bar so we weren't hoarding a table from bigger parties. Maybe about a 15-minute wait for food at most, but that was because there were lots of take-out orders before us.We ordered a small karaage with spicy aioli sauce, the classic tonkotsu ramen and the blaze ramen. Like I said before--the broth was amazing! Noodles were firm and on the thinner side, and the chashu was a tender slab of pork belly that was to die for. For the blaze ramen, you had a choice of 3 levels of spiciness. At level 2, my boyfriend said it was still flavorful with a kick of heat. We highly recommend this place. Apparently there's another Silverlake Ramen in Silver Lake (yes, that was a \"no, duh\" moment for me). We just happened to stumble upon this location. There's plenty of parking in this mall and no wait when we came. Apparently the wait is ridiculous at the Silver Lake location, so just plan ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

       "| Decided to try a new ramen place. When first walking in, we were directed to the right to place our order. There is two options in ordering. You can either order on the touch screen or with the host. We opted to do the touch screen to see the set up. It was very easy to use however if you want to order quick and be sat quick then order with the host. About 3 parties after us ordered through the host and was sat before our order was submitted. We ordered a California roll and 2 Blaze Ramens with pork. The California roll was dry but the Blaze Ramen was good. We were pleasantly surprised that the pieces of pork were very thick and juicy. It was a bit salty but it went well with the broth. The noodles were on the thin side and were hotter bottom of the bowl.Flavor wise: The broth itself was creamy with a subtle flavor to it. For those who like spice, the spicy paste added a nice heat that wasn't overbearing. You can also control the amount of spice by choosing your option of mild, medium or hot. If you would like it spicier there is a jar of spicy paste on every table.Temperature wise: The broth was warm but could've been hotter and the egg was cold in the center. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very clean, modern and there was good music playlist. The restaurant is small but it seemed more spacious due to the ceiling being elevated and the amount of windows. It has limited seating inside but they have a patio area to make up for it. The staff was not too attentive other than bringing our food, probably because it was slow. On the bright side, most of what we needed was on the table. They had good spoons and good quality chopsticks, which if always appreciated when eating a bowl of ramen. We ended up sitting in-between both of the doors since it was the only seating available inside which kind of sucked because we got air coming in from both ways. Price: The bowls were on the pricier side. We paid about $40 for 2 bowls and 1 California Roll. Every side extra cost about an extra $0.50-$1.50It wasn't a bad experience nor a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
       "| This place is located in that new shopping/eating center in Long Beach, right by the airport. My wife brought me here because we both love ramen. We were looking for a new ramen place too, since the one we used to frequent has dropped down in quality quite a bit. Not to mention, Silverlake Ramen has Tonkatsu brother that is deeper, richer, and tastier than any Tonkatsu Broth I've had so far here in the United States. By that, I mean to imply that I've also had Tokatsu ramen, at various other places, when I used to live in Michigan. The noodles are nice and thick, but not too thick. The egg is PERFECTLY cooked with the consistency being somewhere between soft boiled and medium boiled. I believe it has some kind of seasoning on it too, which is a nice touch. When I saw pictures of their Tokatsu on their Yelp listing, I got really excited because the broth looked really thick and milky/cloudy. That's usually a really good sign that the Tokatsu broth is REALLY tasty. Oh, and the pork is really lean, and less fatty than a lot of other ramen places I've tried.Anyway, 10/10, would have again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",
       "| Came on a Thursday night, 6pm ish in Jan. No wait...Minus:1. the weird way to order (millennial-ish kiosk) 2. weird way to get seated (no one really tells you how the order, seating is supposed to work).3. Lack of \"service\"-no one really greets you after you sit, they just look at your receipt, drop your ramen bowl off.. then you are left alone unless you flag someone down for whatever your need.Parking: easy tons a lbx. Park by the tj max side.. easy/out.I really liked my ramen and gyoza! Edamame pass... micowave tasting beans and minimal salt..meh (you should do spicy garlic edamame!!I got:-the shoyu on fire level 2 spice with pork bellyThis was sooo delish! Clean broth, lots of umami. Â The roasted jalapeno, fresh geen onion, slab o meat, corn kernels all worked well.-great ratio noodles to broth (you can order more noodles on the side if you like stuffing your face with more carbs).-noodles were perfect. Â Bit of chewy.. not soggy.-the fire level was perfect. Â Keeps the hot in you mouth without worrying about gonna come out the other end the next day.We sat at the small kitchen counter watching the ramen cooking craze.Its a small space. Â Maybe sits 50ish people max, less tables more community seating.They seem to do a TON of take outs which is maybe why the in Â house service folks are distracted.We'd come back. Â Hope they work on their customer service a bit... would have given 5 stars of so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",
       "| Based on the name of this place, I had a feeling Silverlake Ramen would have vegan options. Luckily their menu clearly states what is vegetarian and they also provide an allergen menu online so I can further research what is plant-based.The Veggie Ramen has tasty miso-based broth! I like that the presentation is very green due to the broccolini, baby greens, kale, and avocado. This is the first time I've had avocado in ramen. Not sure how I feel about that but I also won't kick it out of bed. There's also tofu, corn, and bean sprouts. Though you can't see it in my photo, there are mushrooms hidden under all those toppings. This dish is very noodle heavy which might hit the spot for some people. But I might ask if I can get half the amount of noodles next time. The day we came here, it was a particularly cold December evening so this soup totally hit the spot! bit.ly/2QxjVI3The Mabo Tofu Bowl was quite yummy as well. It is a bit different from other mapo tofu dishes I've had. Usually, I have the sauce mixed in with the tofu. This version has the sauce on top of the tofu. I loved the eggplant! The ginger was a nice addition and I love that it was topped with fresh green onions. I hoped that they had brown rice as an option but unfortunately they don't have it. But I'm hoping they might consider offering it in the future. bit.ly/2QOHmeMThe two times we've been here, they had a cashier taking orders. It makes me wonder why they have the self-service touch screens? I prefer customer service from a real person anyway. And they're friendly and helpful here too. Also, purse hooks at the bar-height tables!Plenty of free parking at LBX including charging stations for our Tesla :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",
       "| Wow! What a delicious and efficient ramen spot! I stopped by to have lunch here and it was everything I could have wanted. You order upon entry so it's quick-- no need to wait for a server or anything and your food comes out within minutes.I order the Classic ramen with pork belly and I could not get enough. The soup was the perfect amount of creamy and the egg was smooth and cooked just right. (My mouth is seriously watering as I write this). The portions are also super generousThe servers are patient and attentive and while parking can be tough, it is very worth the stop.

       "| I came here on a Monday lunch and we didn't have to wait. You order at the kiosk or the cashier and proceed to find your own seat. We got the classic and the blaze ramen, the latter apparently being their best seller. You can pick the meat (we picked pork on both). We also ordered a pork bun on the side.The food comes out fairly quick. The broth is very creamy and thick - really rich ramen. The bowls have decent servings of noodles and soup and a thick cut of pork.I think that the classic and blaze have the same base but the blaze with the spice takes it to another level, so I would recommend this. The bun was ok - pork was excellent but I wasn't feeling the mayo.Overall not bad - I would like to try their gyoza or rice bowls next time just to try.Perhaps between 2 people one ramen and the others on the side would be enough, as I wasn't able to finish my ramen.Then again, it was lunch and i don't normally eat a lot for lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
       "| Supah creamyyyy ramen and pork CHOP belly like at an American steakhouse. They're huge! Friend got the tsukemen, got 3 meats, which was Overkill, but he gave me 1 of them for The Blaze that I got which only had 1, and that's not cool.Geeeeet the black garlic oil with the classic blaze! Try half without, then finish the second half with the oil, A WHOLE DIFF SOUP.The crispy rice appetizer is like eating Hashbrowns! Supah solid. Fun to take a few bites into it. Mushrooms with the salad are solid. Decent portion, nice vinagrette. Feels like modern take on a ramen restaurant, down to the food choices, vibe, and logistics of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| I ate at the original Silverlake Ramen in Silverlake a few years ago, and loved their Veggie Ramen. I recall it being rich, flavorful, and creamy. The company has since rapidly expanded, and when this new location popped up in Long Beach, I was excited to try them again. We ordered delivery via Postmates, since we are out of their delivery range-they are located near the airport. This time, the Veggie Ramen was barely edible. The grayish broth was completely flavorless, and the weird assortment of veggies (broccolini, corn, huge chunks of undercooked soft tofu, avocado (?!)) had a bitter aftertaste. I love avocado as much as the next Californian, but it has no place in ramen. The noodles were okay, albeit not fresh. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen and was equally underwhelmed. We also got the Seaweed Salad, which was too sweet and drowning in dressing, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl, which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall, a really disappointing meal. Avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
       "| One taste of the spicy, creamy tonkotsu broth and I knew... my experience was going to be extraordinary.At Silverlake, the ramen is prepared fresh and articulate. Generous toppings are given, great portion sizes are delivered, and flavors tend to soak me into moments where my tastebuds seemed to have a fun time exploring this new and creative flavor. The broth is Oh, So Creamy!-- the creamiest ever... and that was why Silverlake's experience was so unique.Truly great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",
       "| Silverlake Ramen was one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I moved to LB for college. I've dined in quite often to get my ramen fix with friends and I have only great experiences here! I always order the Blaze ramen because it's so good and gives the right amount of kick. The noodles here are light and chewy. The broth is super creamy and tastes amazing. One thing I found really interesting was the way you order before being seated. It doesn't seem to pose a problem for me so I just go with the flow. Be careful though because wait times here can get pretty insane. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a fulfilling, warm bowl of ramen in the LB area (:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",
       "| So much hype around Silverlake Ramen and now I don't have to drive too far!Parking wasn't terrible as the shopping area is large. Location is a decent size and had a very open vibe. You enter and order at the kiosk or with the cashier and they help you find a seat. Waiters were friendly but it did take some time to flag a couple down since it was busy. Not their fault though.Ramen was a solid 7/10! The broth was great and tasty, just wish I had a tad more noodles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
       "| The arguable king in Ramen on the eastside of Los Angeles arrives in Long Beach. Much like Pizza, Pho, and Sushi, many will judge you based on your favorites and although I am hesitant to commit to a single favorite - on Yelp anyway - nearly half of Los Angeles would swear by Silverlake Ramen which is unlikely due to its location on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, you shouldn't be able to find a real deal bowl of Ramen on Sunset of all places, right? Wrong. Well, Silverlake Ramen has done so well for itself it is expanding with a new spot in Long Beach and another on the way for Irvine in The Spectrum. The Long Beach location is in the center of The Hangar, a newly developed (and extremely trendy) area featuring a massive food hall and boutique-style stores near the Long Beach Airport or the \"LGB\" if you are a local. The interior is modern, sleek, and a little funky as far as a modern Ramen joint goes but the ordering procedure is... well... straight-up wack thanks to the single ordering kiosk being employed, the weird way they assign you to a table, and the line back up this creates. The only plus about this strange fast-casual format is that tips are unnecessary. As for the Ramen itself? I thought you'd never ask. I naturally ordered the celebrated Tonkatsu Ramen. The presentation of the Ramen is quite noble. The portions include an adequate amount of food to serve a single starving person or two reasonably hungry people (perhaps 3?). The pork broth takes 16 hours to render which makes it both intense and savory, with the rich essences erupting at the first spoonful. The Chashu is laid over the Noodles and a bed of Green Onions, which were cleverly glazed on the edges. The Chashu dissolved in the mouth and implemented the ideal amount of saltiness.The Bean Sprouts provided a crunchiness that juxtaposes itself flawlessly with the smoothness of the Noodles. It is merited to mention that a single bowl is remarkably filling, with multiple customers taking to-go bowls home on my visit. For a mere $13.00 after-tax, it is a deal that cannot be missed. I was highly impressed with Silverlake Ramen and cannot wait for a return stop. They clearly have found significant investment capital as this is not the only outpost they are opening - expect to see new locations soon in Huntington Beach, Irvine, Cerritos, Oxnard, and Koreatown. Ramen lovers rejoice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
       "| Expensive for ramen but quite substantial. The Classic Tonkotsu and the Blaze are both super rich. If the broths were any thicker, they'd be tsukemen broth. In fact, the two items are so similar that I suspect the only difference is the chili paste in the Blaze. I love that they use spinach in the ramen. It's not common to find actual green vegetable in ramen and the spinach was a great addition to the creamy broth. I also love the thick chasu pork. It's fatty and tender and super satisfying to bite into. Although there is technically only one slice of chashu, I couldn't actually finish it in one sitting and had to take it home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",
       "| When you think of Ramen, the Long Beach area usually doesn't come to mind. Well, a few spots have opened up and Silverlake is one of them. If you hadn't heard of the Long Beach Exchange - it's a new addition to the food scene in the Long Beach area. Silverlake Ramen isn't located in the Hangar, but as one of the shops next to Georgia's, facing Ulta and Old Navy. Lots of parking. At least that's what my friend and I found when we stopped in for a very late lunch one weekday. I don't know how packed the lot gets during lunch hour or on the weekends however, we drove up, and right into a spot. Walked in, ordered and sat down. No wait. The experience started off well and only got better from there. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu and a Chicken Karaage. I know it's like a broken record when I say it wasn't spicy, but it wasn't. However, the broth wasn't bland or too oily and for my taste, didn't need much in the way of condiments for flavor. The noodles were done al dente, as I prefer. As for the chicken, I liked the juicy meat however, the skin was a little too done for me. Not sure if that makes sense however, it seemed like it was bathed in oil too long and for me the outer layer had an oily taste. The dipping sauce which comes with the order took care of that taste for me - otherwise I might have considered sending it back. The service was friendly and efficient. Attentive not so much as not much was needed. Someone took our order. Someone brought our utensils and water. Then someone brought our order to the table. Not much follow up was needed as the bill was already paid and we were close enough to the water dispenser for refills. I had a pleasant experience. The only feedback I have is that the music volume was a little too loud. Most of the visit, I had difficulty hearing my friend speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
       "| Yay a good RAMEN place in LB!Located directly behind Georgia's, Silverlake Ramen brings the ramen fire! You walk in and make a right to the register to order and pay. You can choose to tip at this time or leave a tip on your table before you leave. They give you a number and wait for your ramen to be served to you. There is outdoor seating as well as heaters. This was my first time eating here and the service was pretty good. The servers bring your drinks to your table. Onto the ramen, I got the shoyu with the pork belly. It was so good. The pork belly piece was so thick and tender. It was a good portion and I didn't even finish it. The noodles were standard and the broth was tasty. The broth could be a little hotter (temperature wise) in my opinion. But otherwise it was good. Parking isn't an issue and it shares the lot with other businesses. I'll probably come back and try the tonkotsu and e karaage!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
       "| Got my ramen delivered but I've been hearing so much about this place. I chose the blaze- a spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! The ramen broth was so tasty. For my protein I choose chicken. I've never had chicken in my ramen unless get it without protein. The texture didn't sit right with me so I took it out. After that, everything was superb. I appreciate the presentation and the prices were average for a joint at the hanger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",
       "| Ambiance: the set-up is totally bad!!! They only have one register open.Very chilled with an average noise level inside as for the outside it's too cramped and one of the table is blocking the exit way. Food: Pork bun is a must, the pork belly is so soft and the Saunders with the bun went well together. Crispy chicken karaage was not crispy at all, it's not what a karaage is usually is (you'll see in the picture). The chicken itself is lightly breaded so it's more like on a healthy side so they should rename it to something else. The Shoyu was good, the chicken was tender and soft enough to chew on, the broth was delicious. The Blaze ramen was okay, the broth was a little too thick for me and the pork belly that came with it was very hard and hard to chew I would have expected to be soft like the pork bun but I was really disappointed. Service: They were lagging because they were having a receipt print out problem and it took them a while till we can finally order, wished they offered a free drink after eating for nearly 10min until our order was place. The waiter did follow up once we were seated but it took them forever for my pork bun or the katrsge and our ramen came first/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",
       "| I was more than excited hearing that a Silverlake Ramen was opening in Long Beach! I love going to and trying new Ramen places but Silverlake will always be one of my staple favorites to go to. I got the spicy tonkotsu, the blaze. First off, the broth was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from the spice. The noodles were well cooked, had a good texture and was accompanied by pork that was very tender. Every time I come here, it is always packed with people, but in my opinion, the food is worth the wait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
       "| Not too much a fan of ramen, but my brother is a ramen connoisseur and took me here since it was new and close to home. Gotta say, the ramen was fine (again, I'm not a huge fan). My mom, dad, aunt enjoyed it so no complaints. If you're looking for a hot bowl of soup, this place will do. ^_^By the way. They use the new type of touch ordering system and then make you wait before you sit down. I'm not a fan of the new trend in touch ordering , but oh well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
       "| My friends & I were so happy to hear about this spot opening up! It's located at LBX, near other restaurants. Parking isn't bad. We came on a Sunday afternoon & surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected for a grand opening. When you walk in, you order first then find a seat. It's not bad, but going in with a fairly big group, it might be hard to find seats together. They do have outside seating though and their tables are pretty close to each other both in and outside. They also have bar seating a high table seating with seats on one side. Their service is great too!It took maybe like 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the classic tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the blaze one. My other friends ordered the same as us. I was honestly expecting a lot since I loved it when I went to the LA location. However, I was underwhelmed.. The broth wasn't as rich and flavorful. The meat was a little chewy and dry for me. They also forgot to add meat to one of the orders. We were a bit surprised by that lol. The noodles were good and chewy though! The egg was fine, but wish it was more of a soft boiled egg. Maybe it wasn't as great since it was still their opening weekend. But definitely will give it another visit in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
       "| I decided to try this place for the first time with a friend for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We didn't have to wait since it wasn't busy. One thing that I noticed right off was the self order kiosk. It was super convenient to just walk in and order what you wanted without having any pressure. The menu on the kiosk provided pictures of the food and it made the ordering process fast and easy. I decided to order the vegetarian ramen and I was a little hesitant at first but it didn't disappoint me. The broth was super flavorful and it had a good amount of vegetables and noddles. They also provide soy sauce and gyro sauce along with a chili paste to add more flavor. I was satisfied with the overall taste, presentation portion, and service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or is trying ramen for the first time. You won't regret it because your tummy will be happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",
       "| I landed in Los Angeles and not even an hour later, I'm already hitting up a restaurant cos' I am just a hangry girl! This was the place I came across first because it was the closest ramen shop to the car rental place I was at. What do I order at a ramen shop? Not ramen of course. I got three dishes: a side of bamboo shoots, a cucumber salad with imitation crab meat and a Shiitake Enoki mushroom salad (Don't recall the proper name of the salad but I can't seem to find it on their website.) The salads were just meh but I don't blame them because this is a ramen place after all. I really like how they have a self serve kiosk where you can make your own order and then you sit down and they will bring you your food. I see this is very common in LA and very uncommon in NYC.The staff was friendly and the place is nice and bright and very welcoming. I like this place. I should try their ramen sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

       "| We were 2nd in the line but the cashier still pushed us to use the machine to order. The machine took longer time and didn't have the toppings we wanted, so we turned back to the line, at that time she has already started the order for the people behind us and the seats we wanted has been taken. Not sure why she did that to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

       "| There's a big flaw with their ordering system. We were directed to use the electronic ordering system at the kiosk but while we were using it, other customers were allowed to cut in ahead of us and order at the cashier. Due to this, we had to take a seat at the bar since all the tables were taken after having other customers cut in front. Im not sure if the hostess was trained to do that or what but it doesnt leave a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

       "| What can I say. This ramen place exceeded my expectations. The food was great and the service was hospitable, almost like I could befriend all the waiters. One waiter in particular was very nice and accommodating, I believe his name was Andy. If you decide to come to this ramen place, keep on the look out for this guy. He'll take care of you. Overall a great experience would definitely come back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",
       "| Came here for our first time and enjoyed the experience but wouldn't call it extraordinary. The ordering kiosks were not working but the hostess was friendly and helped us order. Once seated after ordering the girl who brings the drinks was fast and very nice. We ordered the steamed pork bun and chicken karaage Â as apps. The chicken karaage was supposed to have ginger and some other toppings on top according to the pic and description in the menu but they came plain with sauce on the side. I wasn't a fan of those but my friend liked them. The steamed pork bun however, was AMAZING! My favorite thing by far, the flavor was different and just soooo good. The spicy ramen was good but the broth could have used a little something something. Â My friend and I both ordered med spicy but Her ramen was def mild and came out at least 5 mins after mine when we ordered at the same time :/ some kinks to work out still but overall an okay place to eat dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
       "| We ordered Tonkotsu Ramen . The broth was too fatty & salty for us. And Â the pork was not taste ,like a ramen hub Â one . Â The service is so rude . I guess this restaurant is owned by Korean , so they likes copy of Â other Japanese restaurant . Â That's good idea . They don't know how to make real ramen ..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

       "| I was super excited to hear that silver lake ramen is now in Long Beach. I've been here twice. The first time was in September 2019, party of three on a weekday night. Ordering was simple, the cashier took our order and we were given and number to take to our table (there were plenty to choose from). Food came in a reasonable time, it was delicious (although I would say the original location is better). Now my most recent visit was completely different. Came in on a Friday night, party of three. The line to order was almost out the door and not really moving. Â Apparently they had allowed to many people to order food without having a table for them? We order, then wait about 10 min to be seated. Once dated outside, we were confused as to how the servers knew what we ordered since we didn't get an number for our table. A serve came to our table and asked did we order any drinks, we told them our drink order but were confused by how our food was going to get to us if they didn't know our drink order yet alone our food order. Maybe 10 min later one of our ramens came out. Then nothing for 15 min. Eventually the other 2 ramens came out buy my friend was already almonds done with hers! I had also ordered a side of gyoza which did not come until about 20 min after we were all done eating lol. I asked for a refund on the gyoza and they were very apologetic aBout it.

       "| I am providing this review since there are correctable issues. Â We enjoy ramen immensely and it is in our interest to have Â good ramen restaurants in our area. Â So I decided to take the time to offer this review.It was our first time at Silverlake and my son ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered Shoyu Ramen. Â My Shoyu ramen was barely warm. Â The egg yolk was cold as was pork belly steak. Â I went today because I had a craving but it was not at all satisfying. Â No part of a bowl of ramen, whether it is the soup, vegetable, eggs, meat or even the bowl, should be served cold. Â This is just amateurish. Â The noodle was a bit stiff for my taste but I'll chalk it up as their style. Â Aside from the temperature, I really didn't enjoy the 1/2\" thick grilled pork belly steak. Â Shoyu ramen is a rather delicate Â dish and the half-warmed stiff pork belly sitting in a lukewarm soup just did not do it for me. Â I'd much prefer thin slices of chashu.My son did enjoy his tonkotsu ramen, though it was too spicy to savor the subtleties, if there were any. Â On a separate note, there were no seating that I would have found to be a good table. Â Each was either by the door, major aisle, or the restroom.

There's a lot of potential here so hopefully their quality stabilizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
       "| My husband and I were looking forward to this after hearing good things, and since I had a sudden craving for gyoza, figured why not. TL:DR version -Recommendations for improvement: seating system, carry all menu items, keep utensils and napkin containers full, faster service.Positives: I am a positive person and I can't think of anything! MAJOR SAD FACE.Full version:Walked in and wasn't really sure where to go, we saw the line to the right and followed the line. Ordered at the kiosk, that was pretty cool, except they were sold out of gyoza. Ugh. We scanned through the menu, and there were actually a lot of items sold out, including their green tea (that's all I remember), but that was a bummer. We ordered chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, shoyu on fire. You pay everything up front at the kiosk or with the cashier, including tip. We're all paid up and tipped and sitting by 4:57pm.We sit at the table right behind the cashier, wait, five mins later or so, our chicken karaage arrives... there aren't any napkins in the utensil container on my table, so I get up and get it myself from the communal table... no big deal, we're happy... for now.They have a seating system where they match the ticket number to a table number in their system. There's no table number that you get, no buzzer, food just shows up. The problem with that is that the customer doesn't exactly know that, so it seems like we can move tables if there's a better option. I heard at least four conversations between the cashier and the server not finding the tables, and even a disagreement between the cashier and a server, with the cashier stating to a server \"well if they move what do you want me to do about it?\", in a very non-teamwork kind of tone. Not something I want to hear as a customer, especially since I'm sitting less than a foot away from the cashier (move that table or add a partition please), so I told the server \"hey, those customers moved to that table over there\". But yeah... at least four parties that came in after us moved, and I knew exactly where they moved to because I was waiting for FORTY+ minutes for my food. Not a single server came until I was finally able to flag them down after about TWENTY FIVE mins after the karaage came. And all those people that came in after us that moved, they all got their food before we got ours.If I didn't have to pay up front, and tip these people, I would've just walked out of there. But with the already super long wait, and not wanting to deal with getting a refund and having that be super slow and getting more irritated, we waited. Food arrives at 5:38 FINAL-FREAKIN-LY, and again, I had to get up cuz this time there weren't any soup spoons. Like seriously, I got here before the dinner rush, doesn't anyone check inventory? F***. The food portion was big. Lots of meat, which was nice to see. The pork belly in mine was thick... that's usually not a problem, but if you're going to have thick cuts, at least cook it until it's tender. Mine was tough, and I would've rather had thinner slices. Sure, portion was huge - for $12.50/bowl, it should be. What a mediocre experience. Silverlake Ramen should've just stayed in Silverlake. |\n",
       "| In Raman heavy Long Beach this is still a great addition. Â The chicken Soup style ramen is unlike any I've had before, broth is rich and delicious and the noodles perfectly firm. Â The outdoor dining is pleasant on a warm afternoon. Have beef twice and will be going back soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",
       "| Had very high expectations when trying this place out. We have tried many ramen spots in the past and were hoping to add this to our list of favorites. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Their line was out the door, you had to wait and order at the register before sitting down at a table. Kind of an odd way of doing things, but maybe it was supposed to make the dining experience easier? I am not entirely sure, so we ordered the tonkotsu ramen and a couple of beers. I kindly asked the cashier if we were able to order more beers after we sat at the table. He politely said no, and stated we would have to wait in the line to order another drink. That was unfortunate, but we still had a positive attitude and couldn't wait to try the ramen. While eating the ramen, the chashu pork was cut into huge slices and was extremely chewy. It grossed us out so much, that we pushed the meat to the side and finished the noodles and broth, which were delicious! May give this place another try in the future, but not likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
       "| Pretty disappointed, I was really looking forward to the iconic thick cuts of tender pork that the original Silverlake ramen consistently provided. Just had their bowl of The Blaze, and the the two cuts of pork were very overcooked, hard to chew, and just takes away the overall enjoyment of the meal. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, but still compared to the other silverlake, I've eaten there a few times and never had overcooked meat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

       "| Service was great. But the ramen was not it. I tried this place on opening day because I heard the other locations in LA are popular. I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was underwhelming. Service was good and the location itself is nice but yeah, their ramen is bland. No flavor, not even chilli paste could save it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
       "| Tried the original. Broth is cream based and had no flavor. Only got two pieces of pork and barely any veggies. The overall dish was flavorless.

       "| Came in on a Saturday. Food just average. Service is poor. I ordered and was seated at 9:03PM. First item arrived at 9:32 and the second one at 9:36. Restaurant was about 60% full. The other 3 Ramen restaurants within a 5 minute drive from this location don't make me wait 1/2hr for ramen. I will try this place in another month and see if they have their act together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| Horrible. Waited almost an hour for a couple bowls of ramen. And the service was horrible. The servers were incompetent and didn't have answers for why the food was taking so long. All of the food was coming out at different times. And people who ordered after, got their food first. It definitely was not worth an hour wait. I'll never go there again. They should have stayed in Silverlake. They make you pay before you eat, and It makes sense because then people would leave for having to wait so long. Never again.

       "2   I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well! Â Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "4   Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "5   Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "6   *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "7   Probably one of the best broths for ramen that I've had thus far. There's a hint of roasted garlic in the tonkotsu broth that just completes it.You order and pay from kiosks in the front, then show your receipt to the host in the front who will seat you. There's a variety of seating options: the traditional table, high table, bar or patio seating. This makes it welcoming for parties of all sizes. We sat at the bar so we weren't hoarding a table from bigger parties. Maybe about a 15-minute wait for food at most, but that was because there were lots of take-out orders before us.We ordered a small karaage with spicy aioli sauce, the classic tonkotsu ramen and the blaze ramen. Like I said before--the broth was amazing! Noodles were firm and on the thinner side, and the chashu was a tender slab of pork belly that was to die for. For the blaze ramen, you had a choice of 3 levels of spiciness. At level 2, my boyfriend said it was still flavorful with a kick of heat. We highly recommend this place. Apparently there's another Silverlake Ramen in Silver Lake (yes, that was a \"no, duh\" moment for me). We just happened to stumble upon this location. There's plenty of parking in this mall and no wait when we came. Apparently the wait is ridiculous at the Silver Lake location, so just plan ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "9   Decided to try a new ramen place. When first walking in, we were directed to the right to place our order. There is two options in ordering. You can either order on the touch screen or with the host. We opted to do the touch screen to see the set up. It was very easy to use however if you want to order quick and be sat quick then order with the host. About 3 parties after us ordered through the host and was sat before our order was submitted. We ordered a California roll and 2 Blaze Ramens with pork. The California roll was dry but the Blaze Ramen was good. We were pleasantly surprised that the pieces of pork were very thick and juicy. It was a bit salty but it went well with the broth. The noodles were on the thin side and were hotter bottom of the bowl.Flavor wise: The broth itself was creamy with a subtle flavor to it. For those who like spice, the spicy paste added a nice heat that wasn't overbearing. You can also control the amount of spice by choosing your option of mild, medium or hot. If you would like it spicier there is a jar of spicy paste on every table.Temperature wise: The broth was warm but could've been hotter and the egg was cold in the center. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very clean, modern and there was good music playlist. The restaurant is small but it seemed more spacious due to the ceiling being elevated and the amount of windows. It has limited seating inside but they have a patio area to make up for it. The staff was not too attentive other than bringing our food, probably because it was slow. On the bright side, most of what we needed was on the table. They had good spoons and good quality chopsticks, which if always appreciated when eating a bowl of ramen. We ended up sitting in-between both of the doors since it was the only seating available inside which kind of sucked because we got air coming in from both ways. Price: The bowls were on the pricier side. We paid about $40 for 2 bowls and 1 California Roll. Every side extra cost about an extra $0.50-$1.50It wasn't a bad experience nor a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "10  This place is located in that new shopping/eating center in Long Beach, right by the airport. My wife brought me here because we both love ramen. We were looking for a new ramen place too, since the one we used to frequent has dropped down in quality quite a bit. Not to mention, Silverlake Ramen has Tonkatsu brother that is deeper, richer, and tastier than any Tonkatsu Broth I've had so far here in the United States. By that, I mean to imply that I've also had Tokatsu ramen, at various other places, when I used to live in Michigan. The noodles are nice and thick, but not too thick. The egg is PERFECTLY cooked with the consistency being somewhere between soft boiled and medium boiled. I believe it has some kind of seasoning on it too, which is a nice touch. When I saw pictures of their Tokatsu on their Yelp listing, I got really excited because the broth looked really thick and milky/cloudy. That's usually a really good sign that the Tokatsu broth is REALLY tasty. Oh, and the pork is really lean, and less fatty than a lot of other ramen places I've tried.Anyway, 10/10, would have again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "11  Came on a Thursday night, 6pm ish in Jan. No wait...Minus:1. the weird way to order (millennial-ish kiosk) 2. weird way to get seated (no one really tells you how the order, seating is supposed to work).3. Lack of \"service\"-no one really greets you after you sit, they just look at your receipt, drop your ramen bowl off.. then you are left alone unless you flag someone down for whatever your need.Parking: easy tons a lbx. Park by the tj max side.. easy/out.I really liked my ramen and gyoza! Edamame pass... micowave tasting beans and minimal salt..meh (you should do spicy garlic edamame!!I got:-the shoyu on fire level 2 spice with pork bellyThis was sooo delish! Clean broth, lots of umami. Â The roasted jalapeno, fresh geen onion, slab o meat, corn kernels all worked well.-great ratio noodles to broth (you can order more noodles on the side if you like stuffing your face with more carbs).-noodles were perfect. Â Bit of chewy.. not soggy.-the fire level was perfect. Â Keeps the hot in you mouth without worrying about gonna come out the other end the next day.We sat at the small kitchen counter watching the ramen cooking craze.Its a small space. Â Maybe sits 50ish people max, less tables more community seating.They seem to do a TON of take outs which is maybe why the in Â house service folks are distracted.We'd come back. Â Hope they work on their customer service a bit... would have given 5 stars of so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "12  Based on the name of this place, I had a feeling Silverlake Ramen would have vegan options. Luckily their menu clearly states what is vegetarian and they also provide an allergen menu online so I can further research what is plant-based.The Veggie Ramen has tasty miso-based broth! I like that the presentation is very green due to the broccolini, baby greens, kale, and avocado. This is the first time I've had avocado in ramen. Not sure how I feel about that but I also won't kick it out of bed. There's also tofu, corn, and bean sprouts. Though you can't see it in my photo, there are mushrooms hidden under all those toppings. This dish is very noodle heavy which might hit the spot for some people. But I might ask if I can get half the amount of noodles next time. The day we came here, it was a particularly cold December evening so this soup totally hit the spot! bit.ly/2QxjVI3The Mabo Tofu Bowl was quite yummy as well. It is a bit different from other mapo tofu dishes I've had. Usually, I have the sauce mixed in with the tofu. This version has the sauce on top of the tofu. I loved the eggplant! The ginger was a nice addition and I love that it was topped with fresh green onions. I hoped that they had brown rice as an option but unfortunately they don't have it. But I'm hoping they might consider offering it in the future. bit.ly/2QOHmeMThe two times we've been here, they had a cashier taking orders. It makes me wonder why they have the self-service touch screens? I prefer customer service from a real person anyway. And they're friendly and helpful here too. Also, purse hooks at the bar-height tables!Plenty of free parking at LBX including charging stations for our Tesla :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "13  Wow! What a delicious and efficient ramen spot! I stopped by to have lunch here and it was everything I could have wanted. You order upon entry so it's quick-- no need to wait for a server or anything and your food comes out within minutes.I order the Classic ramen with pork belly and I could not get enough. The soup was the perfect amount of creamy and the egg was smooth and cooked just right. (My mouth is seriously watering as I write this). The portions are also super generousThe servers are patient and attentive and while parking can be tough, it is very worth the stop. I can't wait to dine her again!**they take Apple Pay which is perfect if you forget your wallet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "14  I came here on a Monday lunch and we didn't have to wait. You order at the kiosk or the cashier and proceed to find your own seat. We got the classic and the blaze ramen, the latter apparently being their best seller. You can pick the meat (we picked pork on both). We also ordered a pork bun on the side.The food comes out fairly quick. The broth is very creamy and thick - really rich ramen. The bowls have decent servings of noodles and soup and a thick cut of pork.I think that the classic and blaze have the same base but the blaze with the spice takes it to another level, so I would recommend this. The bun was ok - pork was excellent but I wasn't feeling the mayo.Overall not bad - I would like to try their gyoza or rice bowls next time just to try.Perhaps between 2 people one ramen and the others on the side would be enough, as I wasn't able to finish my ramen.Then again, it was lunch and i don't normally eat a lot for lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "15  Supah creamyyyy ramen and pork CHOP belly like at an American steakhouse. They're huge! Friend got the tsukemen, got 3 meats, which was Overkill, but he gave me 1 of them for The Blaze that I got which only had 1, and that's not cool.Geeeeet the black garlic oil with the classic blaze! Try half without, then finish the second half with the oil, A WHOLE DIFF SOUP.The crispy rice appetizer is like eating Hashbrowns! Supah solid. Fun to take a few bites into it. Mushrooms with the salad are solid. Decent portion, nice vinagrette. Feels like modern take on a ramen restaurant, down to the food choices, vibe, and logistics of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "16  I ate at the original Silverlake Ramen in Silverlake a few years ago, and loved their Veggie Ramen. I recall it being rich, flavorful, and creamy. The company has since rapidly expanded, and when this new location popped up in Long Beach, I was excited to try them again. We ordered delivery via Postmates, since we are out of their delivery range-they are located near the airport. This time, the Veggie Ramen was barely edible. The grayish broth was completely flavorless, and the weird assortment of veggies (broccolini, corn, huge chunks of undercooked soft tofu, avocado (?!)) had a bitter aftertaste. I love avocado as much as the next Californian, but it has no place in ramen. The noodles were okay, albeit not fresh. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen and was equally underwhelmed. We also got the Seaweed Salad, which was too sweet and drowning in dressing, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl, which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall, a really disappointing meal. Avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "17  One taste of the spicy, creamy tonkotsu broth and I knew... my experience was going to be extraordinary.At Silverlake, the ramen is prepared fresh and articulate. Generous toppings are given, great portion sizes are delivered, and flavors tend to soak me into moments where my tastebuds seemed to have a fun time exploring this new and creative flavor. The broth is Oh, So Creamy!-- the creamiest ever... and that was why Silverlake's experience was so unique.Truly great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "18  Silverlake Ramen was one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I moved to LB for college. I've dined in quite often to get my ramen fix with friends and I have only great experiences here! I always order the Blaze ramen because it's so good and gives the right amount of kick. The noodles here are light and chewy. The broth is super creamy and tastes amazing. One thing I found really interesting was the way you order before being seated. It doesn't seem to pose a problem for me so I just go with the flow. Be careful though because wait times here can get pretty insane. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a fulfilling, warm bowl of ramen in the LB area (:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "19  So much hype around Silverlake Ramen and now I don't have to drive too far!Parking wasn't terrible as the shopping area is large. Location is a decent size and had a very open vibe. You enter and order at the kiosk or with the cashier and they help you find a seat. Waiters were friendly but it did take some time to flag a couple down since it was busy. Not their fault though.Ramen was a solid 7/10! The broth was great and tasty, just wish I had a tad more noodles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "20  The arguable king in Ramen on the eastside of Los Angeles arrives in Long Beach. Much like Pizza, Pho, and Sushi, many will judge you based on your favorites and although I am hesitant to commit to a single favorite - on Yelp anyway - nearly half of Los Angeles would swear by Silverlake Ramen which is unlikely due to its location on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, you shouldn't be able to find a real deal bowl of Ramen on Sunset of all places, right? Wrong. Well, Silverlake Ramen has done so well for itself it is expanding with a new spot in Long Beach and another on the way for Irvine in The Spectrum. The Long Beach location is in the center of The Hangar, a newly developed (and extremely trendy) area featuring a massive food hall and boutique-style stores near the Long Beach Airport or the \"LGB\" if you are a local. The interior is modern, sleek, and a little funky as far as a modern Ramen joint goes but the ordering procedure is... well... straight-up wack thanks to the single ordering kiosk being employed, the weird way they assign you to a table, and the line back up this creates. The only plus about this strange fast-casual format is that tips are unnecessary. As for the Ramen itself? I thought you'd never ask. I naturally ordered the celebrated Tonkatsu Ramen. The presentation of the Ramen is quite noble. The portions include an adequate amount of food to serve a single starving person or two reasonably hungry people (perhaps 3?). The pork broth takes 16 hours to render which makes it both intense and savory, with the rich essences erupting at the first spoonful. The Chashu is laid over the Noodles and a bed of Green Onions, which were cleverly glazed on the edges. The Chashu dissolved in the mouth and implemented the ideal amount of saltiness.The Bean Sprouts provided a crunchiness that juxtaposes itself flawlessly with the smoothness of the Noodles. It is merited to mention that a single bowl is remarkably filling, with multiple customers taking to-go bowls home on my visit. For a mere $13.00 after-tax, it is a deal that cannot be missed. I was highly impressed with Silverlake Ramen and cannot wait for a return stop. They clearly have found significant investment capital as this is not the only outpost they are opening - expect to see new locations soon in Huntington Beach, Irvine, Cerritos, Oxnard, and Koreatown. Ramen lovers rejoice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "21  Expensive for ramen but quite substantial. The Classic Tonkotsu and the Blaze are both super rich. If the broths were any thicker, they'd be tsukemen broth. In fact, the two items are so similar that I suspect the only difference is the chili paste in the Blaze. I love that they use spinach in the ramen. It's not common to find actual green vegetable in ramen and the spinach was a great addition to the creamy broth. I also love the thick chasu pork. It's fatty and tender and super satisfying to bite into. Although there is technically only one slice of chashu, I couldn't actually finish it in one sitting and had to take it home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "22  When you think of Ramen, the Long Beach area usually doesn't come to mind. Well, a few spots have opened up and Silverlake is one of them. If you hadn't heard of the Long Beach Exchange - it's a new addition to the food scene in the Long Beach area. Silverlake Ramen isn't located in the Hangar, but as one of the shops next to Georgia's, facing Ulta and Old Navy. Lots of parking. At least that's what my friend and I found when we stopped in for a very late lunch one weekday. I don't know how packed the lot gets during lunch hour or on the weekends however, we drove up, and right into a spot. Walked in, ordered and sat down. No wait. The experience started off well and only got better from there. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu and a Chicken Karaage. I know it's like a broken record when I say it wasn't spicy, but it wasn't. However, the broth wasn't bland or too oily and for my taste, didn't need much in the way of condiments for flavor. The noodles were done al dente, as I prefer. As for the chicken, I liked the juicy meat however, the skin was a little too done for me. Not sure if that makes sense however, it seemed like it was bathed in oil too long and for me the outer layer had an oily taste. The dipping sauce which comes with the order took care of that taste for me - otherwise I might have considered sending it back. The service was friendly and efficient. Attentive not so much as not much was needed. Someone took our order. Someone brought our utensils and water. Then someone brought our order to the table. Not much follow up was needed as the bill was already paid and we were close enough to the water dispenser for refills. I had a pleasant experience. The only feedback I have is that the music volume was a little too loud. Most of the visit, I had difficulty hearing my friend speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "23  Yay a good RAMEN place in LB!Located directly behind Georgia's, Silverlake Ramen brings the ramen fire! You walk in and make a right to the register to order and pay. You can choose to tip at this time or leave a tip on your table before you leave. They give you a number and wait for your ramen to be served to you. There is outdoor seating as well as heaters. This was my first time eating here and the service was pretty good. The servers bring your drinks to your table. Onto the ramen, I got the shoyu with the pork belly. It was so good. The pork belly piece was so thick and tender. It was a good portion and I didn't even finish it. The noodles were standard and the broth was tasty. The broth could be a little hotter (temperature wise) in my opinion. But otherwise it was good. Parking isn't an issue and it shares the lot with other businesses. I'll probably come back and try the tonkotsu and e karaage!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "24  Got my ramen delivered but I've been hearing so much about this place. I chose the blaze- a spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious! The ramen broth was so tasty. For my protein I choose chicken. I've never had chicken in my ramen unless get it without protein. The texture didn't sit right with me so I took it out. After that, everything was superb. I appreciate the presentation and the prices were average for a joint at the hanger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "25  Ambiance: the set-up is totally bad!!! They only have one register open.Very chilled with an average noise level inside as for the outside it's too cramped and one of the table is blocking the exit way. Food: Pork bun is a must, the pork belly is so soft and the Saunders with the bun went well together. Crispy chicken karaage was not crispy at all, it's not what a karaage is usually is (you'll see in the picture). The chicken itself is lightly breaded so it's more like on a healthy side so they should rename it to something else. The Shoyu was good, the chicken was tender and soft enough to chew on, the broth was delicious. The Blaze ramen was okay, the broth was a little too thick for me and the pork belly that came with it was very hard and hard to chew I would have expected to be soft like the pork bun but I was really disappointed. Service: They were lagging because they were having a receipt print out problem and it took them a while till we can finally order, wished they offered a free drink after eating for nearly 10min until our order was place. The waiter did follow up once we were seated but it took them forever for my pork bun or the katrsge and our ramen came first/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "26  I was more than excited hearing that a Silverlake Ramen was opening in Long Beach! I love going to and trying new Ramen places but Silverlake will always be one of my staple favorites to go to. I got the spicy tonkotsu, the blaze. First off, the broth was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from the spice. The noodles were well cooked, had a good texture and was accompanied by pork that was very tender. Every time I come here, it is always packed with people, but in my opinion, the food is worth the wait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "27  Not too much a fan of ramen, but my brother is a ramen connoisseur and took me here since it was new and close to home. Gotta say, the ramen was fine (again, I'm not a huge fan). My mom, dad, aunt enjoyed it so no complaints. If you're looking for a hot bowl of soup, this place will do. ^_^By the way. They use the new type of touch ordering system and then make you wait before you sit down. I'm not a fan of the new trend in touch ordering , but oh well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "28  My friends & I were so happy to hear about this spot opening up! It's located at LBX, near other restaurants. Parking isn't bad. We came on a Sunday afternoon & surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected for a grand opening. When you walk in, you order first then find a seat. It's not bad, but going in with a fairly big group, it might be hard to find seats together. They do have outside seating though and their tables are pretty close to each other both in and outside. They also have bar seating a high table seating with seats on one side. Their service is great too!It took maybe like 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the classic tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the blaze one. My other friends ordered the same as us. I was honestly expecting a lot since I loved it when I went to the LA location. However, I was underwhelmed.. The broth wasn't as rich and flavorful. The meat was a little chewy and dry for me. They also forgot to add meat to one of the orders. We were a bit surprised by that lol. The noodles were good and chewy though! The egg was fine, but wish it was more of a soft boiled egg. Maybe it wasn't as great since it was still their opening weekend. But definitely will give it another visit in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "29  I decided to try this place for the first time with a friend for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We didn't have to wait since it wasn't busy. One thing that I noticed right off was the self order kiosk. It was super convenient to just walk in and order what you wanted without having any pressure. The menu on the kiosk provided pictures of the food and it made the ordering process fast and easy. I decided to order the vegetarian ramen and I was a little hesitant at first but it didn't disappoint me. The broth was super flavorful and it had a good amount of vegetables and noddles. They also provide soy sauce and gyro sauce along with a chili paste to add more flavor. I was satisfied with the overall taste, presentation portion, and service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or is trying ramen for the first time. You won't regret it because your tummy will be happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "30  I landed in Los Angeles and not even an hour later, I'm already hitting up a restaurant cos' I am just a hangry girl! This was the place I came across first because it was the closest ramen shop to the car rental place I was at. What do I order at a ramen shop? Not ramen of course. I got three dishes: a side of bamboo shoots, a cucumber salad with imitation crab meat and a Shiitake Enoki mushroom salad (Don't recall the proper name of the salad but I can't seem to find it on their website.) The salads were just meh but I don't blame them because this is a ramen place after all. I really like how they have a self serve kiosk where you can make your own order and then you sit down and they will bring you your food. I see this is very common in LA and very uncommon in NYC.The staff was friendly and the place is nice and bright and very welcoming. I like this place. I should try their ramen sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "239 We were 2nd in the line but the cashier still pushed us to use the machine to order. The machine took longer time and didn't have the toppings we wanted, so we turned back to the line, at that time she has already started the order for the people behind us and the seats we wanted has been taken. Not sure why she did that to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "240 Loved this place! We are big fans of ramen and Silverlake Ramen did not disappoint. You order at the front and they quickly bring your food out to you. The brother was delicious and egg was cooked perfectly.

       "243 There's a big flaw with their ordering system. We were directed to use the electronic ordering system at the kiosk but while we were using it, other customers were allowed to cut in ahead of us and order at the cashier. Due to this, we had to take a seat at the bar since all the tables were taken after having other customers cut in front. Im not sure if the hostess was trained to do that or what but it doesnt leave a good experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Eat here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "246 What can I say. This ramen place exceeded my expectations. The food was great and the service was hospitable, almost like I could befriend all the waiters. One waiter in particular was very nice and accommodating, I believe his name was Andy. If you decide to come to this ramen place, keep on the look out for this guy. He'll take care of you. Overall a great experience would definitely come back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "247 Came here for our first time and enjoyed the experience but wouldn't call it extraordinary. The ordering kiosks were not working but the hostess was friendly and helped us order. Once seated after ordering the girl who brings the drinks was fast and very nice. We ordered the steamed pork bun and chicken karaage Â as apps. The chicken karaage was supposed to have ginger and some other toppings on top according to the pic and description in the menu but they came plain with sauce on the side. I wasn't a fan of those but my friend liked them. The steamed pork bun however, was AMAZING! My favorite thing by far, the flavor was different and just soooo good. The spicy ramen was good but the broth could have used a little something something. Â My friend and I both ordered med spicy but Her ramen was def mild and came out at least 5 mins after mine when we ordered at the same time :/ some kinks to work out still but overall an okay place to eat dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "248 We ordered Tonkotsu Ramen . The broth was too fatty & salty for us. And Â the pork was not taste ,like a ramen hub Â one . Â The service is so rude . I guess this restaurant is owned by Korean , so they likes copy of Â other Japanese restaurant . Â That's good idea . They don't know how to make real ramen ..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Can't wait to try their other food!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "250 I ordered to go. I felt the price was a little pricey for fancy ramen but they provided a descent amount of food in my order. Â When I arrived home the food was still hot and not soggy and I enjoyed the flavor of the soup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "251 I was super excited to hear that silver lake ramen is now in Long Beach. I've been here twice. The first time was in September 2019, party of three on a weekday night. Ordering was simple, the cashier took our order and we were given and number to take to our table (there were plenty to choose from). Food came in a reasonable time, it was delicious (although I would say the original location is better). Now my most recent visit was completely different. Came in on a Friday night, party of three. The line to order was almost out the door and not really moving. Â Apparently they had allowed to many people to order food without having a table for them? We order, then wait about 10 min to be seated. Once dated outside, we were confused as to how the servers knew what we ordered since we didn't get an number for our table. A serve came to our table and asked did we order any drinks, we told them our drink order but were confused by how our food was going to get to us if they didn't know our drink order yet alone our food order. Maybe 10 min later one of our ramens came out. Then nothing for 15 min. Eventually the other 2 ramens came out buy my friend was already almonds done with hers! I had also ordered a side of gyoza which did not come until about 20 min after we were all done eating lol. I asked for a refund on the gyoza and they were very apologetic aBout it.

       "253 I am providing this review since there are correctable issues. Â We enjoy ramen immensely and it is in our interest to have Â good ramen restaurants in our area. Â So I decided to take the time to offer this review.It was our first time at Silverlake and my son ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered Shoyu Ramen. Â My Shoyu ramen was barely warm. Â The egg yolk was cold as was pork belly steak. Â I went today because I had a craving but it was not at all satisfying. Â No part of a bowl of ramen, whether it is the soup, vegetable, eggs, meat or even the bowl, should be served cold. Â This is just amateurish. Â The noodle was a bit stiff for my taste but I'll chalk it up as their style. Â Aside from the temperature, I really didn't enjoy the 1/2\" thick grilled pork belly steak. Â Shoyu ramen is a rather delicate Â dish and the half-warmed stiff pork belly sitting in a lukewarm soup just did not do it for me. Â I'd much prefer thin slices of chashu.My son did enjoy his tonkotsu ramen, though it was too spicy to savor the subtleties, if there were any. Â On a separate note, there were no seating that I would have found to be a good table. Â Each was either by the door, major aisle, or the restroom.

There's a lot of potential here so hopefully their quality stabilizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "255 My husband and I were looking forward to this after hearing good things, and since I had a sudden craving for gyoza, figured why not. TL:DR version -Recommendations for improvement: seating system, carry all menu items, keep utensils and napkin containers full, faster service.Positives: I am a positive person and I can't think of anything! MAJOR SAD FACE.Full version:Walked in and wasn't really sure where to go, we saw the line to the right and followed the line. Ordered at the kiosk, that was pretty cool, except they were sold out of gyoza. Ugh. We scanned through the menu, and there were actually a lot of items sold out, including their green tea (that's all I remember), but that was a bummer. We ordered chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, shoyu on fire. You pay everything up front at the kiosk or with the cashier, including tip. We're all paid up and tipped and sitting by 4:57pm.We sit at the table right behind the cashier, wait, five mins later or so, our chicken karaage arrives... there aren't any napkins in the utensil container on my table, so I get up and get it myself from the communal table... no big deal, we're happy... for now.They have a seating system where they match the ticket number to a table number in their system. There's no table number that you get, no buzzer, food just shows up. The problem with that is that the customer doesn't exactly know that, so it seems like we can move tables if there's a better option. I heard at least four conversations between the cashier and the server not finding the tables, and even a disagreement between the cashier and a server, with the cashier stating to a server \"well if they move what do you want me to do about it?\", in a very non-teamwork kind of tone. Not something I want to hear as a customer, especially since I'm sitting less than a foot away from the cashier (move that table or add a partition please), so I told the server \"hey, those customers moved to that table over there\". But yeah... at least four parties that came in after us moved, and I knew exactly where they moved to because I was waiting for FORTY+ minutes for my food. Not a single server came until I was finally able to flag them down after about TWENTY FIVE mins after the karaage came. And all those people that came in after us that moved, they all got their food before we got ours.If I didn't have to pay up front, and tip these people, I would've just walked out of there. But with the already super long wait, and not wanting to deal with getting a refund and having that be super slow and getting more irritated, we waited. Food arrives at 5:38 FINAL-FREAKIN-LY, and again, I had to get up cuz this time there weren't any soup spoons. Like seriously, I got here before the dinner rush, doesn't anyone check inventory? F***. The food portion was big. Lots of meat, which was nice to see. The pork belly in mine was thick... that's usually not a problem, but if you're going to have thick cuts, at least cook it until it's tender. Mine was tough, and I would've rather had thinner slices. Sure, portion was huge - for $12.50/bowl, it should be. What a mediocre experience. Silverlake Ramen should've just stayed in Silverlake.\n",
       "256 In Raman heavy Long Beach this is still a great addition. Â The chicken Soup style ramen is unlike any I've had before, broth is rich and delicious and the noodles perfectly firm. Â The outdoor dining is pleasant on a warm afternoon. Have beef twice and will be going back soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "257 Had very high expectations when trying this place out. We have tried many ramen spots in the past and were hoping to add this to our list of favorites. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Their line was out the door, you had to wait and order at the register before sitting down at a table. Kind of an odd way of doing things, but maybe it was supposed to make the dining experience easier? I am not entirely sure, so we ordered the tonkotsu ramen and a couple of beers. I kindly asked the cashier if we were able to order more beers after we sat at the table. He politely said no, and stated we would have to wait in the line to order another drink. That was unfortunate, but we still had a positive attitude and couldn't wait to try the ramen. While eating the ramen, the chashu pork was cut into huge slices and was extremely chewy. It grossed us out so much, that we pushed the meat to the side and finished the noodles and broth, which were delicious! May give this place another try in the future, but not likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "258 Pretty disappointed, I was really looking forward to the iconic thick cuts of tender pork that the original Silverlake ramen consistently provided. Just had their bowl of The Blaze, and the the two cuts of pork were very overcooked, hard to chew, and just takes away the overall enjoyment of the meal. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, but still compared to the other silverlake, I've eaten there a few times and never had overcooked meat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "260 Service was great. But the ramen was not it. I tried this place on opening day because I heard the other locations in LA are popular. I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was underwhelming. Service was good and the location itself is nice but yeah, their ramen is bland. No flavor, not even chilli paste could save it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "261 Tried the original. Broth is cream based and had no flavor. Only got two pieces of pork and barely any veggies. The overall dish was flavorless.

       "263 Came in on a Saturday. Food just average. Service is poor. I ordered and was seated at 9:03PM. First item arrived at 9:32 and the second one at 9:36. Restaurant was about 60% full. The other 3 Ramen restaurants within a 5 minute drive from this location don't make me wait 1/2hr for ramen. I will try this place in another month and see if they have their act together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "264 Horrible. Waited almost an hour for a couple bowls of ramen. And the service was horrible. The servers were incompetent and didn't have answers for why the food was taking so long. All of the food was coming out at different times. And people who ordered after, got their food first. It definitely was not worth an hour wait. I'll never go there again. They should have stayed in Silverlake. They make you pay before you eat, and It makes sense because then people would leave for having to wait so long. Never again.

       "\t<li>'I have been here at least 3 times to dine in person. Hospitality was always excellent but service was always slow since they are always so packed. Either arrive before the rush or order take out.'</li>\n",
       "\t<li>'I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well! Â Needless to say, I\\'ll definitely be back.'</li>\n",
       "\t<li>'I have been here twice in the last two weeks and it is yummy. Great service and awesome food and high quality. My family and I love Silverlake Ramen, double thumbs up.'</li>\n",
       "\t<li>'Eh, it\\'s ok if you\\'re craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can\\'t recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn\\'t add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you\\'d find at a traditional ramen place. I\\'ll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It\\'s really tangy. I don\\'t hate it, but I could do without it.So now let\\'s talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you\\'re face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you\\'ve already paid, you\\'re stuck. You can\\'t just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it\\'s expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It\\'s a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items.

       "\t<li>'Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options.

I\\'m actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it\\'s always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options.

       "\t<li>'*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn\\'t any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.'</li>\n",

       "[4] \"Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \\\"ok\\\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\"\n",
       "[5] \"Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "[6] \"*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \\\"off\\\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "

       "\t<tr><td>I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!

       "\t<tr><td>Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "\t<tr><td>*Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

       "\t I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!

       "\t Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\\\\\n",
       "\t Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food.

       "\t *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

       "| I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well!

       "| Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow. |\n",
       "| Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
       "| *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

       "1 I have been here at least 3 times to dine in person. Hospitality was always excellent but service was always slow since they are always so packed.

       "2 I ordered togo from this Silverlake Ramen at LBX yesterday, 5/5/2020. (Cant help but wonder if I was the only one in long beach eating ramen on cinco de mayo ) but anyways, I ordered then basic tonkotsu ramen and I was immediately impressed. The soup of the ramen was subtle and flavorful. Not at all salty or oily. The veggies tasted delightfully fresh and the noodles tasted as tho they were cut and boiled to perfection. The piece of chasu on top was melt in your delicious. On a separate occasion, I ordered the pork bun. It was massive and delicious as well! Â Needless to say, I'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3 I have been here twice in the last two weeks and it is yummy. Great service and awesome food and high quality. My family and I love Silverlake Ramen, double thumbs up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4 Eh, it's ok if you're craving ramen but feeling too lazy to drive to Irvine or Torrance for proper ramen.Ordered The Blaze, spicy with pork. Wow, it came out in a comically huge bowl. Looks like a giant lake of broth with a little island in the middle made of noodles and spinach. The presentation just looks sparse and weird. Speaking of weird, the spinach was unexpected. I can't recall ever seeing spinach at any other ramen place. It just didn't add anything to the dish. Just a soggy green thing floating in your bowl. And there was one piece of sea weed clinging to the side of the bowl, far away from the noodle island. Again, strange sparse presentation. The noodles were average. The pork was super tender and was braised or blow torched to give it a slight crust. The broth was \"ok\" at first. But towards the end, I grabbed a spoon and slurped it up. I noticed a strange aftertaste. Not very pleasant. Also ordered the chicken karaage bowl. When it arrived at my table, it was covered in so many things. Again, not what you'd find at a traditional ramen place. I'll admit the actual chicken was great. Meat was tender and had the right deep fried crispiness. But the rock-n-roll mayo and terriyaki sauce ruined it. I highly suggest ordering it with sauces on the side. Also comes with a shredded pickled daikon as a garnish. It's really tangy. I don't hate it, but I could do without it.So now let's talk about the weird workflow. You walk in. You see one person at the register, and you see these giant tablets on the wall where you can self-order and pay with card. You ask yourself.. if you know what you want and you want to pay by card, do you cut ahead of everyone else in the line and punch in your order? Or do you wait in line and wait til you're face to face to the tablet? Well, I observed people doing both. I saw some confusing faces, as well as angry faces from people waiting in line. This is just a terrible idea, especially since not everyone was eager to use the giant tablet, even though they were paying by card at the register.Next, after you order and pay, you wait for someone to seat you. During peak hours, this is even more terrible idea. Because sometimes people eat slow and it takes a while for an empty table to come up. But since you've already paid, you're stuck. You can't just bounce to some other places to eat if the wait is too long.Prices are on par with other ramen places. If you think it's expensive, then you need to stick to the 25 cent Top Ramen you get at the store. I think karaage bowl is a great deal. You get a good amount of chicken and rice for the price. It's a meal in itself.Overall, not a bad place but not my first first choice either. I might go back and try their other items. But I wasn't impressed with their Blaze ramen and the weird workflow.\n",
       "5 Very hip, very modern, very cool. I like it. The menu has a great mix of fresh, fried, and flavorful soup options. My guy had the more lighter broth ramen made with chicken, I had the ground chicken and egg bowl and we also got the cucumber crab salad and karaage (I think). I'm actually not a ramen shop girl because I feel like it's always a bit rich plus a lotta carbs but this restaurant does an excellent job of providing non pork options. With this place you order first and sit down, I love that there's an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. The servers come around to collect dishes as you finish, as well as to refill your water glass.Also great that you have a view of the kitchen while they're making your food. This restaurant is located on the other side of Georgia's, across from wahoo's and the opposite side of panini kabob grill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6 *Heavy sigh* I had high hopes for Silver lake Ramen, hearing all the great reviews of their other location. I came in after the lunch rush about 2:00pm, and browsed the Yelp reviews--a bit of a mixed bag regarding the ramen, so I tried to keep it safe and order the chicken karaage bowl, and the pork bun. The bowl was pretty bad, something was \"off\" about the white rice, and the chicken tasted like fast food chicken doused in aioli. I think I took two bites and tossed it out. The pork bun wasn't any better--now I may be comparing it a regular bao but the pork was under-cooked and extremely fatty (not sure if this is norm), but the flavors of the ingredients in the bun did not go well together, at least imho. Lastly, I was in the restaurant for about 5/10 min, but the fishy smell is intense! They may need to install some more ventilation--I cant imagine eating there for lunch and going back to work smelling like fish :(I love ramen, so I will be back to try it the ramen.
